After lockdown the executives have become highly unprofessional...service left incomplete..and least bothered to keep up the promise to return back..slow service...moreover..did not bring equipments for pedicure..if possible I would have asked for refund back but what to do..even the company is giving just missed calls of half a second ring...instead of proper call back..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ac service was very poor. Feeling hot than earlier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad experience with the urban clap... They can change time and professional any time and even without informing the customer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Worst customer care service. Had booked room paiting for a particular date and after confirming twice a week prior, at the last moment they called saying that we don't have painters available currently and we have to reschedule it. On asking they dint even tell me when and just cut the call. Trying to call again but not responding at all. Never ever recommend them. Highly Unprofessional (un) urban company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent services,services,Company's service,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unprofessional and worst coordination ever I have faced. My last two booking the professional didn't turn up and worst part the UC team does not know wher there professional whereabouts. Highly recommend to all to search other companies who can better service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tum log safety charge kis baat le rahe ho , only mask k 39 rs . urban company loot macha rakhe hai",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Booking, assignment and confirmation experiences are excellent. The service partner was on time, and did a very  job. However, in post service feedback some questions about partners service and behaviour are inappropriate and in fact indignifying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great service at our doorstep.. really happy with uc service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app,app,App utility,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst experience they have taken my booking but not assigning any professional. No emergency help line number. Return my money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The service of Urban Company is great. But, the cleaning personel did not has his safety gloves available with him. An amount of 50 Rupees is deducted while booking for safety hygine, but the professional said he was not provided safety gloves. Please look into this for their safety.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont book so called professional from here, because they are highly unprofessional. Cancelled my appointment last minute and the reason was useless. No guarantee that they will come or not. I regret big time why i booked here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These people will take booking and professional will call and tell that he had taken a private booking outside and request you to cancel the booking as he will be penalized... They will also provide booking with professional rated 2-3... This is seriously unprofessional.. call center will not be able to provide any solution and they will deduct 100 rs from your payment reimbursement for it.. pathetic service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am changing my review based on my experience in last service delivered by urbanclap... The professional doesn't deliver the service on time.. And usually request for a different time.... And on that different time slot denied visiting.... Urbanclap doesn't care of customer and unreliable...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Booked for hair cutting. Excellent person and did the job very cleanly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WORST SERVICE & Unprofessional Customer Care Team. No one arrived for my 12 PM booking today. The driver called my that they were on their way in 10 minutes but no one came so I had to cancel our booking. This is the second time in one month that we had to face the same problem. The customer care team is very unprofessional too and will not even try to help you. Also, they can't track the location of their cleaners properly. Overall, UC is a complete waste of our time and will not recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are very unprofessional.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unprofessional technicians they even don't know to give right connections Waste of money The so called professional attended for repair of my AC is searching in youtube what the problem is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible company. They rescheduled 2 times on me and didn't come. I suggest you don't use them. Very disappointed with them. It's better to give business to some smaller companies then them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I booked for 2AC services.. They massage me when service expired and before that I didn't get any reminder So they earn I lost at least they gv us reminder. I m very dissapointed with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
professional approach in reasonable rates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 app. Bad customer service. Been facing a location issue for the last one year. Since I brought it to the notice of the back end team nothing has been done and I am receiving numerous calls explaining the same thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" service, reasonable rates for 2 bathroom cleaning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interesting service at doorstep...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice experience at home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"excellent service at home ,no need for going out to parlors when we can have it at our own home",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Used to be , its utter nonsense now. Home Painting service is a joke",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very nice services,feeling relaxed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expensive for small jobs. Need to rethink on rates....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Inspite of a professional not being assigned at the scheduled time, an amount of 299 rupees has been deducted on cancellation which is against the policy. Very poor service with no intimation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very Poor Service for home cleaning. Confirmed to send 4 guys but sent only 2 and full charges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very  service provided by Urban Company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 ac technician has defrauded us of 7500 Rs..by saying he has installed a new compressor which other technician from urban company itself said hasnt been installed..i have complained several times in urban company but received no help whatsover.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hopeless services, need supervision closely otherwise your payment is waste. So poor performance. They Take OTP before they start work..there after you are ""kathputli"" water stain is cleaned, and many more..hope less waste of money",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Booked for bathroom cleaning for 9th st 11am. The guy called me and said he cannot come because he had to pick up a friend from railway station and asked me to cancel. I canceled amd rebooked for 3 pm. That guy also called me and asked to cancel as he could not come due to rain. They have made me wait for one whole day wasting the day completely. Call centre number will not be answered. One more thing, when I booked for 11 am they charged Rs. 727 and when I booked for 3pm they charged 787",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please entry for only want do learn and make the  future in ours line so make sure your team and your company are improve and management the understood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another bad experience 1st time my refrigerator stopped completely and this time the issue with AC still persist,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bekar hai very bed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible experiences. This company does not have respect for customers time. Their solution is to offer petty cash that does not get you 1 hour or cleaning. They do not even call back to offer better solutions and this happened more than once. Disrespectful and unreliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No option to edit rating, after first visit the pest control guy directly asked me to give him  rating. After the few days, cockroaches increased, I called him and he said that he will come after 4 days which never happened also, he stopped responding to the calls. Now experience initial was ok however, after few days, it became negative and I do not see an option to edit it. Finally, I called your call center and I was informed that there is no option to change the rating",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent work keep it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" experience with UC no need to search the various persons, single place single search best option and preferrable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Date - 9/10/21 Urban company should be closed. Pathetic and worst company I have come across in my life. The cleaner is not come on time and do not answer the call. Customer service person always say I am sorry or they credit 40 aed in wallet. But what the point if the cleaner is not come. I will post this feedback across the social media website.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Professional didn't turn up for the appointment, even after rescheduling twice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Totally disappointed with urban company this time. The customer care team has no idea of the prices or services mentioned in the application. They do not have clarity. The description in the application is not clear. You book the service basis the details you see on UC app and the professional will tell you another story and deny for the additional booked service. Then you speak to customer care team, they have least idea about the detailing and then they will tell you, this is not included mam.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have used the service of Urban co. They seem to be deceiving clients with the brands mentioned v/s brands used. They mentioned Loreal and they are providing am unknown brand called Elysian. (You won't even find it on Google). I wonder why would they charge extra and do this for premium service. Might as well take basic package,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect work. listened all concerns politely and done the work without any hurry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very Happy with the services of UC as they are very professional, transparent & result oriented. Easy & flexible way of communications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not working as professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's  and easy to use. In busy life we get great support from urban company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was booking for salon but not suitable timings available. This app gives u time according them. I thought k achha hoga agar sb kam iss app k through ho jayega. I m working women. Worst app ever i experienced. I will never install again this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice but customer care should be responsive .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If there is option for not giving any star,I wud hav choosen dat rather.Extremely unprofessional,I cant describe it in words.I booked my appointment on 6th oct at 3.30pm...no professional has been assigned to me till 3.21p.m.Then I thought to reschedule it and took tha time on 8th oct 3.30 pm.and Guess what again the same thing happened to me.no body was assigned.the customer service provider tried to console me by saying that they will assign sum1 within no time but they fail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent cleanup.. bohat hi sweet hai hetal thank u beta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not able to book service for around 3 months that too after registering for membership.. It says no professional available for the selected dates.. and there was no option to select days.disappointed..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sincere service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ek Dum Worst Company. Bilkul bekar aur bakwaas company hai. Aur bilkul jhoothi company hai ye. Apne kaam par khadi nh utarti ye company....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gloves did not wear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Network issues Job starred around 11AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We opted for full house cleaning for a vacant house for which we paid 5100/- rs., But utterly disappointed with the services where they didn't even cleaned few areas, and when I rated 2 star on the survey after the completion, and also I opted for 3 day warranty service, which is expired now. Even now, no one is responded. And yesterday the cleaning guy called @t 10:30pm and saying that he will come at that time 5o work, and started all rubbish, when I told him no to bother us at that late time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You should change your company name to Fraud company. I made the booking for RO annual maintenance on 14th July but technician denied service, despite speaking to you senior customer service I have not received full refund amount till date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! Do you even have a customer care number???? I have booked for a bathroom cleaning two weeks ago and canceled it within 15 mins... I got a msg that the money will be refunded within 7 working days... it's two weeks now... how do I even contact you guys....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The company behind this app exploits workers. Horrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The reason I have cut stars is There has to be a help center with phone or atleast chat to clarify the service before we book. Like in cleaning service, no where it is written whether they will clean walls, move the furniture for floor cleaning Otherwise, have been very happy with the company and professional sent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic AC servicing. They charge more than double of MRP for any parts. It's much better to call your own technician n get it repaired. At least you will not be robbed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some of the professionals are very  and ethical and at the same time some others have a bad attitude, they want to over charge by quoting additional charges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are not on time they late more than 20 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highly thought of app to make life simple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was the most horrible experience. I booked their salon services and prepaid. The professional on the day of the delivery cancelled thr booking. I was promised another booking after three days like my time is not precious at all. Then a man helped me to reschedule it to thr next day only to not get any professional assigned again for the second day. I had been trying to contact them but to no avail. The poorest customised service i have ever experienced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Straight case of cheating..Their engineer come damaged the refrigerator taken the money ..When we call Samsung people they have written that Urban clap mechanic has damaged the same.. When we complained to Urban Clap team one escalation manager Mrunal evetytime come ...I only want mine fridge to be in original condition..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Women hair cut service is unprofessional. Booked for 8th Oct 10.30 am, last minute got a call from urban clap for rescheduling to 9th Oct at 11.30am. The professional neither called or turned up for the cut and colour service. Very disappointed as my schedule was topsy turvy because of this. No other service is like this one. But this one am really done with. Never gonna book women cut m colour from UC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"professional and perfect service ,seeing  results",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Absolutely pathetic service. I've used the services of Urban Company a couple of times and have been disappointed every single time. Moreover, they damaged some equipment during kitchen cleaning services, but they didn't take any action after that despite repeated complaints. I gave 1 star rating to the professional, but somehow it became 5 star after a few hours (it remained 1 star for a couple of hours after I gave the rating). They are highly unprofessional and cheats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service ever seen. They cancel/reschedule the services 5 minutes prior to the booking slot and dont even inform about it. There beautician simply cancelled the booking without calling. Why do they take the bookings when they are unable to provide the service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Awful, cleaners don't turn up. Even after apologising and rescheduling for the next day cleaner still didn't show. Happened 4 times now so I'm done with them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They broke our washing machine and ac worst app they never come for revisit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On Video Consultation I was told part of my washing maching is available but technician who visited said we don't have part to fix my washing machine and even charged visiting fees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just dont expect timely service of anything after booking through the urban company, each time the professional complains that they are overloaded with work , so this blaim goes to the conpany itself. After giving a clear time slot the professional each time requests for a before and after time as they can't make it at that time. No professionalism, they are just running behind profits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful. Life has become much easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was refered this app by my friend but no credit of referal is received by me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Provides incomplete information of the booking. No link of booking vis a vis the person who will service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Service, customer support and staff ðŸ‘ excellent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Highly Disappointed. This Ac repair guys are worst, you call them for water leakage they will open some screws near Gas area and leave it open so we call them again for Gas refilling which is high an amount Service. This guy imtiyaz didn't want to sort water leakage but was insisting on Gas refilling saying it's not sufficient enough for cooling. When had to tell him, we have no complaints with cooling he literally left the Gas thing open, and now within 15 days AC is not cooling. Disgusting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Site working very poorly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CHEATERS! Don't trust and pay amount fr yearly packs. I have booked a super saver pack of haircut (9services in a year )in urban company fr Rs.1048.I cannot attach scrensht. I have completed only one haircut service on 12th JUNE ""GADDAM ARAVIND"" is the person . I am unable to rebook service frm my yearly premium pack as it not even available in the app. Such a stupid app with zero communication to talk with customer care. Worst app which deletes the premium pack from the app after paying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was trying to book for a fridge cleaning service but UC plus membership got selected., Now there are no options to contact urban company... I want the subscription to be cancelled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are not providing various services at my location even after buying plus membership I can't get the service, Wastage of spending money in the name of plus membership kindly refund my money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" working urban Patnar, but urban company, is too much commission for partner, madly 4200& anpadh job almost 20%, many cutting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Harassment of calls and no one is taking responsibility of any services, they are giving us false commitment only, not to suggest people to trust on service all time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Please provide service for trinitycomple,kada agarahara",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even after 1 hour i am still waiting for maid. Helpline people keep calling so that i get irritated and cancel the booking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst services... Spoiled my ac... No professionalism at all...please don't book from these guys... They damage your products and then pretend to fix it...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"too , highly professional",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is worth to call Urban clap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No option to contact customer care. Would love to see a option to contact with them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very poor service.Engineer do not care about schedule.Also customer support very unresponsive.So My suggestion to take service from local service provider than urbÃ n company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Started painting job with delay, however job was finished excellently and satisfactorily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Offlate it has turned into an irresponsible company with no customer satisfaction. Nothing is done to give a proper service to the customer. Be careful of the beautician Lipshi Biswas. A completely unprofessional woman who has no commitment or value for her words. Never expected such a service even when complete payment was made in advance. I will make sure to spread the word among all my known and unknown definitely mentioning the beautician's name as well as the ineffective customer care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Untrustworthy in the commitments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Simply super..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience. Unprofessional people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everything during sofa cleaning was excellent, very professional cleaner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Be aware with advance payment. Specially, don't take painting work. They do not have professional and proper customer support to help in your problems. They insist you to continue with unprofessional & less caliber people which may spoil your work by investing huge amount",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a better experience so far. But at times I had some bad experiences. All depends on the urbanclap executives and their services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed for haircut service Only male members are allocated the project Scheduled twice but still no changes At last I had canceled the project for hair cut Please hire female members for hair cut especially for women Rest other services are OK.. no issues with them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have take bath room cleaning 599rs services...it is not worthy.. I could of clean myself instead of paying them...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They said one rate before visit.. after visiting they are take lots of money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service...very disappointing. No control by the company. Taking complete payment in advance. But no refund in case of service deficiency. Left completely at the mercy of the vendor who caused the deficiency in the first place. One of the worst consumer facing companies I've ever dealt with. Also when i went to rate the service. It was already rated 5*. Again something fishy by the company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It seems most of the masseus doesn't have massage bed..For saloon at home theh provide one of the worst services. I booked appointment at 6pm its 6:37 pm still none is assigned and i didnt get a call back even. Agsin the same problem today reschediled yesterdays booking to yodays 2 pm, none is assigned. And there is no response ftom urban company. Worst service ever",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic unprofessional service!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible experience.Had booked a Salon service on 6th October.The girl said she is having fever.Rescheduled it to the next day.Again a beautician was assigned.After seeing many negative reviews on her being late every time,I asked her to come on time.Suddenly noticed that the booking has been rescheduled on its own to 11th October evening.Then Urban clap customer care promised to return the amount along with penalty.STILL NOT RECEIVED ANY OF IT. NEVER TRUST UC specially during any festival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best and affordable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their Service.... they are very professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Massage kabh se start kar rahe ho ap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very disappointed...unprofessional staff..if you are aware then you can take risk but if you are unaware of services you are taking they cheat you...yet not resolve my problem...I will never avail their services again and never suggested anyone to avail services..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It would have been faster and easier if I just went to the salon. App is also very slow to load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No backups. If the professional is unable to deliver service at a desired time. The only option is for the customer to cancel the request or postpone the whole service. There should be proper resource management. You should have some backups to avoid reschedules . I don't find customer centricity here. Although I have few  experiences with earlier appointments, I am really disappointed this time. Now I have to postpone the repair. ðŸ˜©",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘Œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Your charges for a job includes some hidden charges ,like visitation charges and personal hygiene charges. I wanted an electrician for one fan replacement and one fan installation In place of the listed charge of Rs 307 for this you wanted another Rs 100 more ,ie 33% extra. Why? This is not fair I didn't place the order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"UC is a fraud ... Donno y they r taking 100 or 49 rs for PPE , sanitizers or mask. Openly looting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wish there was an option for zero star rating. Got home painting work booked with Urban Company. The supervisor has left the work mid-way and no resolution has been provided. Its been 5 days since I am following up and all we hear is empty promises and copy-paste answers. Would never recommend Urban Company to anyone. You lost a customer forever. In addition, I will ensure no one in my family uses Urban Company. Pathethic service with zero commitment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service ever you cannot trust this app and service people's .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
price is higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very poor experience. Now a days they are taking bookings and last moments they cancelled and if you called, they have lots of excuses and finally after lots of argument they will assign someone who don't have any experience about the work. Its totally unprofessional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I had complained few days ago about the bathroom cleaner doing his job badly and below expectation and felt wastage of our hard earned money. But, even more surprising not to have received any call from UC customer care!! It appears that UC is having a casual approach towards customer satisfaction and least bothered about wastage of money of their customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bo facial bhi time se kam me ki and head message bhi 15 min hona cahiye 7 min ki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unprofessional experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These guys will take the booking for beautician services and then cancel the last minute. This has now happened almost every time. The worst is when I do a booking it shows available time slots and then an hour before someone calls assures they will assign a professional and exactly after the time slot call and inform they are sorry for the inconvenience. Worst ever. I would rather go to a local salon for my services. Most unprofessional services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are the worst service provider. They will take a booking promise some one will come over and no one shows up. Especially the beautician services. Its better get the same done else where. What is the point of booking a slot when it is convenient for you then they will either cancel or not pick the booking till the last moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have applied for beautician role for urban company on sep 1 2021. After paying my training fees I have completed my training within 21 september 2021. Till today I didn't get any confirmation regarding selection. till today after multiple enquiry I have not recieved any update on my appointment. Also operation team is not ready to refund the amount and worst situation I have facing right now because of over trust on urban company. They fooled me by taking my kit fees 10200/- and nt gav appoin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cleaner never showed up and my card still got charged. And no word from the company at all. This is the service you can expect from this company in Dubai.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 job done for chimney cleaning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I booked for refrigerator repair. They charged 1200 for a part replacement which can be purchased online around 250-300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Very clean and professional services. The cleaning staff is very . However I used the salon service for mani padi, the lady was always distracted on the phone, she put some wrong top coat, it sticks to everything and within 3 hrs of service started chipping off. So much value for money. Now I have to get it done all over again!!!!!!@@@@ I should have spent all that money on tips n toes from the beginning, big mistake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm deleteing my account, What can i say, the disappointment i feel from this company ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¾ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¾... i guess the reviews alone are enough for everyone to never come across such service like this AGAIN ,starting by how uncoordinated the service delivery timing is and unexpectedly being reached by the vendor asking for time change due to traffic, even after agreeing on the time change no show up,, after me following up they said it needs to be rescheduled, and of course customer service not helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They never send their so called experts on time. Later they refuse to refund your amount as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Design of the app is very . All services are professional but grooming rate is little bit higher than market. It is expected as it is a home service. Professionals are neat and clean and also sanitise their tools in front of me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seems some fraud business. Buying membership you were supposed to get atleast 100 discount on every service but same is charged as visitation and safety fee plus additional. So no use of buying membership.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prompt service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the service was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@UrberCompany 's service is pathetic .... They have just started their business in Guwahati. I have booked my schedule prior one day before and after got the confirmation I had been waiting like a fool for approx 1 hour but no one from Urban Company has b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They also cannot assign professional and once again they said to reschedule or cancel. This is the first time I am facing this. I always prefer urbanclap for their salon service but this time very poor service they gave. Very much disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No callback in case of issue. No contact number provided,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a shame to even rate this application! This is a hoax service provider! They simply take bookings without checking if professionals are available or not. We booked for a wiring problem and would run out of back up in probably 2 3 hours. They never assigned an electrician. Even to contact their customer care we need to wait for 30 mins minimum(ifffff we are lucky) and then they say they have a shortage and the electrician cant come today! The Customer Care - All they know is to say Sorry!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst app ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have booked deep home cleaning services But when the concern person Mr Farhad reached the site they denied to do the work One of the concern person Mr rahul call and told Mr Farhad took 20000 to clean the work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I want refund for the exterior painting material . As there is no update yet. Also they are not picking up call. I already asked them to cancel ,still no update. I want to cancel the project. Also please process refund and take your material from here. Worst costumer care service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I had a very bad experience with urban company, I have got rashes, redness, bumps and itching all over my body after waxing, very bad quality of products used, Worst service. And when complained about it to help center, they shared a coupon code for doctor consultation which is invalid, worst costumer support. Never book an appointment through urban company bad service and worst customer help. My skin and health is suffering and also I had to spend huge amount on dermatologist and medicines",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Pathetic service guys, who don't know how to talk to customers. First they dont even call me for an appointment at 10. Reaches my place at 12, doesn't even apologize for being late and after that AC installation should cover all parts which user has not received. Don't show a rate card for repairs. This is not a repair, this first time installation. Else raise the rate and tell us what will be reimbursed when user has the part. After that technician has the audacity to tell me talk responsibly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My experience with home cleaning started really well but once you get into their scheduled booking you are in for surprises! *After sometime the scheduled cleaner( who you have trainer investing time& effort) never turned up * Lame excuses like car breakdown/ accident/ running late and hence some other cleaning company got assigned each time *UC went to extent of lying scheduled cleaner is on annual leaves but she wasnt. Instead she was assigned to new customers owing to her rating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a more than a happy & satisfied customer of UC. Looking forward to more services from them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't have customer care number only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got SERVICES 5 AC 4 SPLIT and one window Mr Gurffan came for service In one split AC on checking it was not cooling He cane again and said Gas have to be filled again he did same But AC is still not cooling We called him again he charged Rs 250 and said every thing is fine We checked again and found that AC still not cooling at all We informed him he sent some assistant as we do not allow a unknown person We requested him to come personally he promised but did not turn up till date,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is the third time in the past year where I have experienced lack of professional conduct from the service professional. It is my mistake, inspite of their negligence and hurried-ness in trying to complete a job past three times since last year, as a result leaving a job unfinished at the end of the day, that I have still opted for Urban company service whether it is house cleaning, ac service or most recently car cleaning. I have also complained before but a revisit isnt a rectification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Poor Knowledge AC Service Technicians. Booked ac service, ended up sensor failure due to miss handling of technician. Another person came and replaced partial sensor, with problem still existing, UC asking me raise new request, pay and get it fixed. Don't go with the fancy app and become prey..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 time saving service for reasonable prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We had taken bathroom cleaning service couple of days ago and we were not pleased with the service we got from the professional assigned for it. He asked us not give 4 star rating, but we gave 4 star rating despite not being happy with his work. Since that incident, we had opted for multiple services from urban company and to our surprise we were not assigned professional for any of those services. PS : We been opting services of urban company since two years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The company don't have any proper technician to assign, no proper solutions and poor customer care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Urban Company is doing unethical business.I had booked a Loreal Sunsiglow facial of Rs 1299/- on 5th October.They sent the facial kit of Cheryl's cosmeceuticals which costs only Rs. 300/- and when I raised complain they are saying both are same, whereas written at the backside in very small letters is that this is being marketed by Loreal. It's clear that it is not a Loreal product, it's being marketed by Loreal. They do not want to address the issue and are keeping mum. Please be cautious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"No hair desser is available right now at my location that is Ichapur Nawabganj, North 24 Parganas, PIN-743144... Even though it was available few months ago...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pathetic customer support, typical example of the rise and fall of a promising company. Repeated rescheduling and scheduling not being met promptly, no customer service empathy. Even more pathetic is there is no refund option of subscription . Now i have paid a subscription for a service which I won't use. Feel sorry to see you fail wish the company does things right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you want to book a full home cleaning only full payment required for checkout!! Why should I pay full before taking service? They already got huge investment from foreign investors, so now they are too hungry to cheat customer as well as their professional. Please don't ask my registered number (so called common reply from customer service). Anybody can check ""only full payment required for checkout"". By this way You will definitely loose more genuine customer!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very unprofessional service. Their workers come and always say we will do your work personally. Don't book with urbanclap and their work is unprofessional. It's my advice to all do not book anything from here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fraud company..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Disappointed.. Not at all upto the mark. Dont know P of professional. After complaining Uc cs,workers started work properly.. Better u ppl look for local maids to do cleaning work coz UC is not doing wonders even after charging huge amt. After struggling with these ppl to get our work done they requested me to rate them nicely so that their job wont get affected. There is no difference in essential, premium n platinum.. Platinum cleaning is basic only",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fake company hai ye ese koi bhi service na le,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Worst company I had ever seen. They don't hire professional but tied up with local vendor and local vendor don't know how to get work done. They ruined my painting work in home. Whatever consultant suggested we paid but on ground reality they send us professional who worst painted it. Even customer care is worst they don't value feedback provided by customer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Essential services Ã t our ðŸ¤ž,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No customer service being provided. Only calls being made by the customer care team and no follow-up with regards to confirming that problem is solved or not. One way communication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier I had posted a negative review it seems to have disappeared I again say the same the team they sent was the worst Mr Kamal Prasad did such shoddy work my brand New kitchen cabinets are scratched so when ever I look at them I really curse the company for employing such third rate characters Even over all the cleanliness was just not there from any angle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their staff are no longer courteous OR well trained.

A real 3rd class experience from a world class company like Tata. Book them if you want to spoil your schedules & events.

"Booked for painting. First week they aksed me to reschedule as at the last minute their painters were not available. Then next week after working for one day they are saying the someone in ONE of the painters family is ill so NONE of the painters will come today. Very bad experience. They are not using any special equipment, so i don't see any point in using them in future if i have to deal with labor problems myself like this anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Complicated UI. Cannot find the membership benefits. The company promotes membership in every booking but hides the membership benefits somewhere in the app. If it is something then you must understand what's the need for it. Can someone from the team tell me where exactly in the app I can find the info I am looking for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic service. They don't have any customer care number so that we can call them. As per their convinent they are rescheduled your bookings...! Will Give 0 rating to UC services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic service booked water purifier service got leakage 3 time and professional is not willing to fix it permanently..plus there is no customer care to speak to which makes it even more pathetic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So much bad experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since a few months, I have noticed that the service partners have not been punctual. One has to call repeatedly and follow up. There is a delay of at least 30 minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Poor customer service. I have opted for bathroom cleaning, the agent forced me change slot which I accept and asked him to clean balcony which he want to do offline and did very bad cleaning. Since I was not at home while he clean I could not check. Hence, I called customer service for rework but they could not arrange saying it is offline and I need to work with agent directly. What the hell and why you allow agent to force offline service? Very pitty customer service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pathetic level of service, no customer care no available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zero star to UC. I booked full home cleaning service 2 days prior. They confirmed my booking. So i waited whole day on the day of service. But they don't even bother to call or assigned any person who can come and clean my home. Wasted my whole day. I have to pass from mental torcher also. Because they don't have any customer care number. We can send request to call and then only they contact us. So i have to wait whole day for that. Pathetic and very unproffezional behaviour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False promises made by customer service . Surprised to see this with UC. Now no response to repeated mails. No option to escalate the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very unprofessional service company Had rasied complaint regarding ac service with 11 pointers.so far no resolution no action taken by uc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience....totally disaster..waste of time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad service no time management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Totally unprofessional behaviour and services. My booking has been rescheduled without any information. Urban clap cheats and does not care about their customer's convenience. Not a single customer care no to reach. Horrible situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very bad experience. It is very deceptive, the services mentioned are not offered as it is, playing word games. The services you book in home cleaning seeing what they write, is totally different to what the service providers tell. It is horrible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic service. Don't ever book a washing machine repair from them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No value of customer's time.Shifting to local alternatives.My gate has better service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't see any proper response from customer Care for any questions or queries asked by different customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didnt get uc credits when i joined rheough referal. There is no option to contact for such helps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How can you cancel the prepaid booking after confirmation without any communication. Unprofessional behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very unprofessional... service providers never respond the calls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Customer support is very poor, They give missed call and close the ticket with the below explanation Dear Customer, We tried to contact you thrice for your complaint regarding our service, however we could not get through. We are closing the query for now, please reopen the complaint via our helpcenter if any further assistance is required:xxxxxx - Team Urban Company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the best services available.in India.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some detail info needed choir some packages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst customer experience I have ever seen in my life. Super unprofessional! I would not recommend it to anyone. Not worth the energy and time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sofa was cleaned thoroughly and as per planned timing. persons were very corteseous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However I have given the best rating post service but when I heard experience from someone else about Urban they are quite satisfied and the pics they have shared post cleaning was quite surprising and the service we got was not upto the expectaion.And this clearly states that it was fault of cleaning guy. Moreover I remember after my service when I told him that this could be better cleaned then he tried to convince that it's your myth and all. Sorry to say but my Ist exp. is unsatisfactory â˜¹ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best app for booking affordable services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1lakh out of 5 as per behaviour and work . The Best!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall urban company is not good, as i booked it for home cleaning a week back,for today's date, urban company cancelled it today itself.because of today's schedule i cancelled so many other events.very bad Urban company and your apologies will not help as i suffered alot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over Promise & Under Deliver !!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"PROFESSIONAL NAME - ADAM (Carpenter) Visit Date - 22nd October.. WHY IS THE REQUEST STILL OPENED ?? THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'M RAISING THIS COMPLAINT ON THE SAME ISSUE... CALL ME.. DON'T CLOSE THE TICKET WITHOUT MY CONFIRMATION.. WHY IS THE REFUND AMOUNT NOT PROVIDED YET AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS COMMUNICATION... WHY ARE YOU CHARGING Rs. 169 When I'm a UC MEMBER ??? In the portal it shows as Rs. 118 only. WHY IS THE JOB STILL OPENED??? Also , 2hours delay by professional...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paid 30k for a painting some walls in my house Patches everywhere and a poor job done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Easy to use, contains all the needed details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Electrician charges are very high. Just to change a fan condenser, the charges are Rs 169/-. Outrageous charges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service with extra efficient staffs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am trying to book sofa and carpet cleaning from last 3 to 4 days and then they say we don't have professionals to help you right now and that we will get notified when professionals are available and they never notify. Very bad experience this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Professional services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I should give 0 star worst service.. every professional is cancelling after accepting the booking.. couldn't reach them after a clear conversation also there is alot of misunderstanding..worst experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highly pathetic..if you don't have professional why the hell you have started your venture..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Toll free contact number. The technicians assigned are from the location of the phone and not based on the address of service. The technicians back out citing location challenges,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Of the Worst app Don't ever install it Once we do the payment They will not come your home waste of time and money and space of your money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The experience with urban company app was really good. I booked for cleaning purposes and the job was done perfectly. The girl sheela was very professional and I liked her work very much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You have mentioned a product which you have not introduced yet. You don't give service for IFB washing machine but you didn't mentioned it in your application,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expensive applicance for any service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never expected this poor quality service leading to damage of the product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent..quick response...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today I sheduled the booking of bathroom cleaning. But before sheduled time the professional call n show his inconvenience to come n tell me to reschedule. I am very much disappointed because I have also lined up my work due to diwali festival. If the professional is unavailable today , Urbanclab should arrange the other one on that time for sheduled booking. it's not acceptable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disappointed with the commitment and non delivery of services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
House cleaning and dusting :- You have not assigned any one for this work and didn't even updated what is happening whether your so called professional will come or not . Worst service from your side . refund my entire money along with penalty amount . If you were not sure whether you will able to provide service or not then why you have taken amount and said booking accepted? Pathetic service. I kept sending request on your app for call but no response. You are just cheating public.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had booked urbanclap salon service and had completed the payment formalities. At the last minute booking was cancelled by urban clap and rescheduled without intimating me or informing me about the change. Most unprofessional and disgusting attitude without any accountability or commitment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very poor service.. Please don't take any painter or home cleaning services from urban company. These guys not come at the scheduled date or time and than call to reschedule it for next week and than keep on rescheduling it even after doing complete prior payment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The service is really bad. They never respond in time nor keep their commitment. The app is also quite terrible, and most of the time, they are having technical issues with the app as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Superb services..great jobs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service not gud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thes guys promises so many things.. but never fufill it...!! 3 times they have refunded me on a washing machine service in which they were not able to assign a professional to it... If you guys are not able to deliver services please don't promise...!!! But customer care guys are very efficient...!!! They call you 5 times in a day to APOLOGIZE...!! Fed up of these guys.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had heard a lot about Urban Company but my experience with them was horrible. Not at all responsive and helpful. Deal with them at your own risk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is 4 th time the assigned person has cancelled the appointments by giving fake reasons and cancellation charges got deducted though it was cancelled by their service provider.. do not respect the time as well had booked appointment for today at 3 later the person cancelled they assigned new at 4 and till 4.45 no one came... Client service should be the priority but it is not ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Commitment level so much poor...non reliable. Schedule arrival was 1 PM on today as of now, no one has arrived for work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
job well done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience they accept booking but not assign professional on time in festive season specially. Urban CEO should work to improve customer satisfaction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible experience of my life. Company professional has not arrived whole day and made excuse to not come. This is not urban company it is a cheater company. I request all to not use this cheater company ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pathetic experience, the professional was assigned for 3pm. And it's more than an hour, she hasn't arrived. The professional is not reachable. Absolutely waste of time. Please think twice before you take a service. No value for time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very worst company very bad eaxprience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hi UC team, UC rescheduled painting services from 20th Oct to 22nd Oct and then I was told that due to painter unavailability, booking will be either rescheduled after Diwali or cancelled. I talked with person who took booking and he assured me that he will initiate cancelation and refund all paid money, someone will call me. I somehow accepted all inconvenience caused to me. Now at least refund my money. This is worst ever experience. Email sent to your help desk, complain raised. No action.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sofa cleaners done incomplete work. Not recommend this type of work with your proffecionals. Very unprofessional work and not bother of our timings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very Poor Support. After seeing their thousands of ads, I booked Entire house deep cleaning services. By Friday I got my home painted, for Saturday morning 8.30 AM, I booked for cleaning. Also arranged 3 more people for household shift on Saturday. We were waiting from 8.30 to 10.30, no one came, after 10.30 we got to know there is delay. I tried to ask call back, there is no one to answer. I than posted on twitter, 7 people called Sir we are checking. Later they said we don't have team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hopeless service. I did my painting and again seepage issue in 15 days of service. But UC refuse to help. It's local painting services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worst service ever, professional was insisting on cancelling, so that company can make 100Rs as cancelling charges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very good professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Totally disappointed from the technicians they took money while my booking was cancelled and they don't even tell that no money will be charged after cancellation and took my money after that I confirm this thing from customer care now getting money in my wallet back this is kind of stoling they are doing it was my first time and experience was so bad they silently took my money and then I get to know that after cancellation no amout is charged,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service. Technician is knowledgeable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had done the booking for kitchen cleaning service and it was booked for today 2.00 but the professional Mr. Abhishek Upadhyay had cancelled at 12.00 saying that he is not well and reschedule for 2.30 but we are not able to do and he said we will receive a call but still no call. Worst service and no reply from your side. Please do not trust these people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good behaviour ..... nice work done ðŸ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I paid for the monthly subscription. A chef came from Sep 16 till Sep 29. Then no chef came. I lodged several complaints on the app. I requested a call back. No response. On Oct 15, I get a call to renew the monthly subscription. When I informed that no chef came, I was told that they are sending a chef from the next day. No chef came. A fraud company. They take your money and do not provide the services. I am still waiting for the chef. People be aware of this fraud company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience. In terms of Salon at home Prime and Classic services this company is not at all trustworthy and there beauticians. One beauticians has damaged equipment and another prime service beautician didn't reached on time even she had not informed or call us that she is coming or not. When we tried to call her her phone no.is switched off. While booking and time slot they show the slots till 7.30 but after 6 no one will come for home service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent & satisfactory service provider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience stilm I didnot received any callback of after giving bad review. No customer chat and call support avaialable. And also no one hear to hear our complaints. Sevice engineer not repaired the product and not refund money no calls recived from comapny about service made. he is working on his own company no interventions in it. Very poor business and customer oriented service I ever seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my first experience with urban company is nice .I love the service .I will try this again .I will recommend my friends this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thankful for providing at home comfort and taking care of good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great Service provider,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service was very gd. Gd human being staff and friendly nature .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Booking cancel without any information. I was waiting but no information about cancellation of booking. Totaly time waste. Slot shows all timming scare available but actually no service available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good and timely service. But charges are not proportional to work. Two ceiling lights in our parking area not working. Bulbs have to be replaced. I bought the bulbs. Electrician removed the failed ones, put new one and wires are joined, a tape was tied on top. For this replacement of two lights hardly in 5 mins, after membership discount of Rs.50, the charges paid are Rs.328. Please review the charges. It appears to a bit on higher side.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please keep well experienced professionals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tecnician was an efficient worker who understood tha issue correctly n went about his job as a professional!.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazing service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get all daily essential serivce in time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All experience is good apert from LOCATION ADRESS , WHICH IS HARD TO SET EXACT AND THE APP DONT HAVE OPTIIN TO SET ADRESS MANUALLY.... This app is more of technogy oriented which is a problem when NOT SIMPLE and UNPROFFESIONALLY MADE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wonderful job done by your guy Mr.chadrashekar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today was the first time I used (or rather, sought to use) a service from Urbanclap - this was a salon at home service. The service was supposed to start at ,11am and no one has arrived at the venue till 11:50. I received no information from the salon lady (Nisha solanki )about her lateness (she has my number of course), neither does she pick up my call, nor does the Urbanclap app has a feature asking me if my service has started on time. Pathatic service",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How come you guys are charging 549 just to replace a tap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Used the service for appliance repair and electrical work and extremely impressed with the quality service provided by the UC partners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service was good and on time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"VERY POOR SERVICE, WORST EXPERIENCE. I have booked the beautician for 3 pm as I have to be somewhere. Komal Dutta, the beautician cancelled it last moment and said that she don't care if I complain or give a negative rating. I urgently need the beautician for today and this was not expected. Really pissed off with your service ruined my plans for today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UC is awesome options for relaxation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad service my brother book kitchen clinging service but not proper cleaning and incomplete work so Very poor and worst company Very bad experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their help centre is useless as there's no interface for clearing queries about services before booking them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pls be careful while making home cleaning booking I order essential full home cleaning for 3999 , on arrival the cleaners denied to clean saying you have selected the Empty home cleaning options which was totally incorrect because there was nothing mentioned about It while ordering , when asked the customer care to provide me where this is mentioned they said cannot as now the service is discontinued , So they smartly blame the customer for selecting wrong options and pay extra for new service",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5 star because they started their services and operations in Patna, Bihar. Will love to promote them here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No help option for membership renewal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Feels like Purchased new Sofa after cleaning... Nice work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic services they are sending unprofessional people for your bookings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a wonderful experience. Urban clap made my Diwali cleaning really easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good professional people with excellent service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No response for call i m not happy urban company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best company & solve client issue properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service. No comments section in booking sections.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst experience ever. Never trust. This is a cheating company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst Experience with Service and customer care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very unprofessional Cancellation without replacement twice in a row. They're even not refunding the membership fee that i had taken along with the booking. Bad bad business tactics and customer service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Waste of time, they don't value their customers time.they hold me for the home salon services from last 2 days, after so many reminders given to them on very third day of my booking they only say the word sorry,which they don't understand the meaning of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellence five star rating carpenter services by professional as wellas by Urbanclap company.Really appreciable. Recommended to all needy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible service,just keep client waiting whole day through and when the time of booking schedule arrive,a ph come wid a voice full of honey that sorry ma'am we r unable to give service today,and after taking the time for next day same thing tepeate again.now tell me what review u expect from the client.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worst services ever!! If you wanna go for some unassured services, then go for them because no matter when you book, either 1 day ago or 7 days ago, they will cancel it without even asking you. They've caused me so much of inconvenience at the very last moment of my booking time and didn't even provide any better solution but they just called me up to inform me that they have rescheduled my booking on their own at the last moment which I had booked 7 days ago. Just horrible!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is the worst app i have ever used. They say the beautician is on the way since 7.30 am but she is not here till 10a.m and finally she did not come. The staff( members) is such unpunctual. The phone no. provided is switched off and there is no way now to contact the so called ""beautician"". UC is itself saying that we r not able to locate the person.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fully satisfied with her service. very calm perfect in her work, friendly and very smooth in her work... paisaaa wasool",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My experience with uc was working fine and then I took their membership. Now no one comes on time. Their phones are switched off. And uc customer service never calls back. I shouldn't have taken their membership ðŸ˜•,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Post work not owing warranty. Unprofessional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please provide correct information in app half information conflicts between us and the compay. I have booked full home cleaning platinum scheme in app they have not mention that wall cleaning will be wet or dry so paying so much of amount Totally not satisfied with the information in the app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service I have faced it's my first time with urban. No proper communication no customer care number. Really can't refer to anyone. Worst service no customer care support. No value of customer. Really worthless please don't waste money and time with urban clap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am editing my comment just to notify you people. Do not take their services at any cost and situation. Their so called professional are been trained to interact so confidently and can make you fool easily. I mean just to fix a basic hose pipe to wash basin they are charging me 830 although I have my hose pipe with me. Also they think our money grows on plants. Hahaha the plumper who came to fix the tab today said ""mam this will charge you 249 extra for this"" Pathetic people these are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nowadays in mumbai most of the flats have toilet, bathroom and washbasin in only one bathroom but some flat have different toilet and bathroom and outside washbasin which is comparatively small. If I book 1 bathroom to clean then the person cleans only one bathroom either toilet or bathroom . They say you have to book two bathrooms .but then it becomes very costly to book separate two bathroom and separate washbasin. I don't think this is feasible for one time cleaning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very Bad experience with UC. We were scheduled painting work on 22nd Oct 21 but at the last movement they denied to do and asked to reschedule date which is showing after 18 days. Now I am finding other painters to do the work but due to Diwali no one avilable. So please book services from UC accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic experience with urbanclap. They never arrived for service and no response from customer care also. Your money will be lost....do not go for this company. Go for better one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Frustrating service charges till now. We heard good feedback from our circle. But it is bad with our experience till now. The AC resource called 0.5 hour before and inform that it will be late by 2hrs and for lock replacement carpenter says only labour charge is paid(which was almost Rs.500/-), and we don't have option to cancel without fee, when the consultant calls late.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't trust this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urban company is too good so I am happy ðŸ‘ðŸ˜,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can't be more worst, total cheating scam.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I booked a maid service for 4pm the app accepted and deducted the amount as well. When the booking time came I checked at 4pm and the app said *cleaner on the way* for which I gave a little more time thinking she would be at my place soon. But after 1 hour of waiting the aggravated me called the helpline to enquire where the cleaner was and to my surprise I was informed that *SHE CANNOT MAKE IT SHE WAS NOT WELL AND LEFT FOR THE DAY* I was furious that why was I not informed at 4pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst during festive season. Cancelled my bookings despite booking it couple of days prior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service of urban clap. Professionals are not assigned for more than 8 hours of decided time. No customer care response. No callback. Ridiculous service. Even people working in UC are tired of their own company service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont take house cleaning service , bery unprofessional with lot of conditions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Complete unproffesionals. Untrained labours and untrained supervisors. Hosrrible experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My 1st experience was good with urban, may be further they provide the same good service with a reasonable price. By which a common man can afford",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I still haven't availed the service I have booked.tbe appointment for Satuday 23rd Oct for deep cleaning at 11pm, previous nite at 10:30 pm I get a message that our service partner will not be able to complete the service on 23 rd Oct and with out even asking me they have confirmed the booking for 24th Oct,8am atleast before sending the message you can call the customer and ask them if they are ok with it ???I am struggling to find out where can I reach them..but in app there is no way to reach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waste service close my Problem else refund Fraud company urban clab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent work and very responsible. Shivkumar was very patient and ensured that all expectations are met.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Guys, the service is brilliant but fare is double. A girl named Zara will take the bookings and the cleaning guys asks to give cash or gpay to a person called Faizal Khan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to know about the disposable items which are used for the customer are reusable or disposable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wroste service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Technician is so good in skill and cleaning of our bathrooms are fully satisfied,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"booked paint service for my flat and at that time I have given slot on 13th Oct, but on 13th I get call that they have to reschedule my service on 23rd I don't know why is it so. And if that is the case then why give me 13th date. And today is 22nd I tried to connect with customer care they told that you will get painter details on 22nd morning and till now j don't have any details and I am not sure that whether my work will start on 23rd or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Company is not keeping a check on professionals who are are a cheat, charged around 9000 for repair and parts change of my tv which is again giving same issue after 4 months and I now learn that the parts change price they changed for was not actually changed. This is really bad and feel cheated just for having faith on Urban Company. I regret taking service from the company instead should have gone to local repair shop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All companies provides best services in the start, as days go on they show their true colors.They offer free consultation over video but put a telecaller to speak to u who pretends as an expert. We had a leaking fridge, the person in the video nor the the technician asked for model number. The technician saw the fridge and bought a tray slightly thicker than polythene cover worth not more than â‚¹50 installed it and charged around â‚¹550 for that entire repair. Don't trust a corporate for repair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bad UI. It lets user select services, go through all the pages and says 'service not available in your area' on payment page! This is such a waste of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app doesn't allow to talk to any person who is going to give you the service. U cannot contact urban company by urself u have to wait for them to call and this happens only when u book the service. If I have to get certain things cleared and understood how do I go about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wonderful experience. Thank you Urban Company for making working women life easy and hassel free. I am using almost all the services. One suggestion give some rewards or any other benefit to your regular client.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice Work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very much useful app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
farida proffessional gave excellent service especially bikini wax she did it with patience nd cleanup was very relaxing I would recommend her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I opted for TV service for No display issue. I had paid the booking charges Rs.450. But the TV was not ready after 10 days, i got my Tv return. But they collected â‚¹ 300 for transportation charge. (I dont know why I paid the booking charges then. Worst part is, the fee is not reflected in the app). I was insisting the service person to return the tv on 6th day onwards. But anyhow, I have wasted Rs 750 with this service. Really worst people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality is not consistant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gave it one star for the offensive/racist ad. ðŸ‘Ž,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our payment back log is still pending with you and u told us that it would be done in few days but it is month over but not our amount paid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HORRIBLE experience trying to book a service, you can keep waiting no one cares. All they know to say is sorry, what should we do with 10 times sorry?? I booked a salon service 3 days back for Thursday, no one was assigned for Thursday 11 am. When I contacted them, they called back and said sorry and rescheduled for Friday 5 pm. Since Morning a person has been assigned but no one turned up, I tried contacting 3 to 4 times no one helped all they kept saying is sorry. Finally am left stranded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They have a lot of nagative points. Let me highlight a few. 1) A big number of so called 'expert professionals' don't even know the basics of their work . Some of them are extremely uncouth. 2) Charge is exorbitant in some cases. 3) These 'technicians' are mostly strangers so that can be a huge security threat if you allow them in your houses without proper checking. So unless you are too lazy/sick to go out or the service providers in your vicinity have dumped you, try avoiding this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No customer care. Wastage of time of the customer, no response from the professional",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My experience is horrible Worst management and unprofessional staff . Today i booked manicure and pedicure service at 6:30 pm without my confirmation the professional has cancelled my slot and rescheduled it without my Permission Pathetic UC they waste customers valuable time. Do u think customers are fools/ idiots to wait longer time for your unprofessional workers as if we have no work at all and there is no replacement no backup of your professionals i dont recommend anyone to use this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sincere and dedicated service provider,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As soon as Hindu festival Deepawali is here, jerks like this company has started promoting pollution theme ads in their marketing campaigns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no customer care number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pathetic Service, I booked a bathroom cleaning service on 17th and was not at home when the executive left. Unhappy with his service I left a message to him on chat and shared pics of the cleaning. He called me and assured me that he will come on 18th, however he kept postponing eventhough I followed up daily. Today I raised a complaint with Urban Company and they told the warranty for my service expired yesterday 21st and there is nothing they can do. Another shocking observation is that the App shows a 5 star rating given by me for the executive even though I have not rated him at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service provided by ur beauticians is no doubt awesome But facing refund issues most of the times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't take responsibilities of their own work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very pathetic management. No ac technician available daily in a row of 3 days! When yo don't have any service why you have open this company to waste people time! @urban,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best disinfection services company in my knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anurag is best tv repair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've booked saloon 2 times. 1st time 2 executives called multiple times to reschedule appointments due to them having prior hospital engagements. And when he came the experience was not even near to what you advertise. I myself had to sweep off all hair and clean the place. This time also when I booked after calling me thrice the executive again had some 'fake' hospital appointment and wanted to reschedule to some other day. This happed after my booking time and confirming at last minute.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Disappointment, multiple rescheduling for a recurring customer without prior notice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a very unprofessional experience as the beautician first took the appointment and then later asked me to reschedule it. When I rescheduled it there was no response from the UC team regarding assigning of the beautician and I had to cancel the booking. Its unprofessional and highly not recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fraudulent salon service providers sent to our house with fake Covid certificates uploaded on the website Service providers I'll equipped with kits and do not do the complete process Still no resolution on the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rate also high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They are cheaters. They charged me around 400 rupees extra for the services and then they said that yes it's our mistake, we will refund the amount, but after that they got disappeared, even not replying for mails and calls also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First time to use the app requested a pcr test at 11 , no body showed up no body replied to whatsapp or to the complaints . And they called back at to reschedule for later the same day.. disappointing service",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am frustrated with UC now. We opted for home painting, the surveyor or the painter guy messed up the texture wall painting and the customer care lady do not care to call back and update on the status. We got lower quote from the local painter but instead we opted for UC as we thought it would be faster and better, but the experience is horrible.. Pls have the courtesy to call back and resolve the issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get sofa cleaning done... Reasonable and very nicely cleaning work done. Very polite n professional person.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good service at your door step.. amazing Experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of the Professional they assigned are always in hurry, they will do the service they have booked for but didn't care about any other thing. Like if you book for a sofa cleaning service, guy will not care about near by walls, nd in hurry they will leave a lot of stains on it. If you call a painter they will paint, but didn't care about holes to fill by putty.all they want to give them 5* rating. Washing machine installation and uninstallation, it's poor experience, they can damage ur items.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SCAM SCAM SCAM, UC is now doing SCAM with customers. Fooling customers. They started their own range of beauty products and launched candle pedicure and manicure. I booked to try and see whats different. Qnd it was a total waste of money. They did cleansing Scrubbing And then used 5 rupees wali normal candle ka wax for massage and then pack. Thats it. For it they are charging 949 for pedicure and 849 for manicure. A local parlour can provide a better service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have been booking prime salon service from 3 days 1st day they said professional is busy, will do tomorrow . I said I want 3rd day now, They said Ok.. on 3rd day they said professional will be late . I said Ok. But after 1 hour they cancelled service on their own.. i told them on phone also if u dont have time just tell. Still they kept befooling me. Worst experience I ll never book from here again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All services are of named by professional only Our local people do same things with less price and by better way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waist of money waist of time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent job,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service is good but floor was not clean. Video shows the new one. but actually it was only attractive for the customer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beautician didn't arrive in time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worst company ever!! Dont ever use them ..so unprofessional have no idea whats going on in company..send cleaners from other companies so unorganized and unprofessional. My cleaner was booked weeks in advance my only day off with kids and no show..they did Nothing to resolve ..have no respect unprofessional managers cany fix any issues..Dont use them ruined my whole day off!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Such an unprofessional service: Failed to deliver the service after two rescheduling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a good service and have very politely behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"UC service is simply sooperb, my complaint was microwave oven, that was rectified result is totally satisfied. thank you technician Mr Sharan. ðŸ‘",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible experience. The app showed available slots but after booking no beautician was assigned to me. Even after rescheduling the next day same thing repeated. Please do not waste customer's time if you cannot provide the service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very unprofessional behaviour of Urban company technicians. They intentionally charge for different issues for the Services. Very very Bad experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible. The guy was on his phone throughout. Dint complete his job in 2 hours when 85 mins was alloted. Dint even touch the floors. Stains were left all over. Wish could give 0 stars. And yes, extremely unprofessional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beautician didn't come on time also they don't provide any comp of, worst experience ever had",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They do not provide a customer service number . I cant connect to them for any quieries. So it is a ridiculous app service provider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I booked beautician. Everything was fine but facial service is not up to the mark..nd please remove honey wax if your beautician is not doing that for any reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good and promt service. I used many services and all are satisfactory. well managed and trained staff. Quality service and best in industry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor skill of technicians. They say No for everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pls pls pls don't waste your time by booking services on UC. They reschedule the appointments as per their own volition, without considering the requirements of their customers, causing severe inconvenience to them. I WAS a fan of UC , unfortunately because of some experiences, I cannot even call it the worst. It's level is sooo much lower than worst. I wish I could rate it less than one. PLS DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON UC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Experience of overpriced in name material. To charge they estimates material more than double than required to keep charge high. After painting you will be left with extra material to waste. There should be return policy or go only without material. They will be reluctant as they are earning by selling material one donot need. However painters were good but urban company is taking undue benefit indirectly. I have left with unused 3 boris of white putty, bottles of paint, tapes, 5 pkt gypsum puti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had got pest control done. Moin khan had done a great job. I gave him a 4 star by mistake. I would like to give him a 5 star. I could not change it later. Take this into consideration while rating him in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible experience for the first time. Rude carpenter who refused to do the job and said to book another appointment. The attitude was unbelievable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very bad experience, seriously I am just waiting for them to clean my house while dilwali but didn't get to hometo clean.I choose premium full house deep cleaning and waiting from 4 days they didn't come and not ready to refund the payment even....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am trying to book for paint consultation, but when I am going on the payment page it is showing no professionals available. I am from Gandhinagar. Custom care no. is also not reachable. Can someone help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very good work done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always top notch service given.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have booked for home deep cleaning and professional was not booked on the day. And they shifted for 7 days more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service Zero No Customer care support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"super satisfied, I recommend to try once UC services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was given some credit and voucher which got expired automatically. Services were not used because of covid and now when I want to use credit and voucher show expired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good app good service team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very poor time sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pathetic. Charged me 500 for just drilling 2 holes for gyser. Tightening gyser pipe + 500. Just nonsense. It's just horrible not recommended. "" Please read rate card before thinking it's affordable""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst product ever .fake company ever .i booked O3+ facial normally o3+ facial charges around 2000-2500 if you get it done in a parlour .But the product they used in that it was mentioned 270 Rs .then I filed my complaint. executive were not able to justify that price they said out of 1800 which I paid 270 Rs is the product charge and remaining is the professional charges.then they again called me and said ma'am remaining is the professional charges but it is not mentioned on site anywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charges are high already that to charging extra for safety is too much for not following any safety protocol. Unprofessional people involved and damaged my special items,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non existent customer service. Better call local service guys. Too many loopholes in App which helps their techinicians to cheat us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fully satisfied, Experienced Professional, Quality of service, Timely completion of work Hassle free service most important honest and well behaviour but little bit costly.If costing may be reduced then Everyone go with Urban company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Got my chimny repaired but came to see that filters have not been changed , though you have charged for the same . The company has played fraud with me . Please revert.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sneha was very excellent and fast at her work.she is a nice person too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service provided under home cleaning premium package by Mr Manoj Kamble and his team.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very nice.very polite and done the services effectively,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"please reduce service rates, costly service than others",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She is very polite and calm.Carried out hr task with full dedication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There salon service are highly pathetic. They give u confirmed appointment and last moment they cancel it. Highly disappointed and un professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont serve in my area . So disappointed .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very bad experience as they have no control on their professionals.2 beauticians canceled the booking in 1 day and, all they could offer is, a plain sorry. Won't book now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No customer care number for redressal, even for subscription members. Customer care only for namesake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Money deducted while online payment but app is showing not paid I have paid twice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible experience with urban company paint service, third class surveyer without knowledge about paint job survey karne wale ko ye nahin pata ki pehle se kaun sa paint ho rakha hai, jo colour choose kiya uski jagah kuch aur colour bheja, paint khatam hone ke baad 3 din wait karna pada 1lt paint ke liye, superviser customer se paise mangta hai paint mkt se purchase karne ke liye, customer care se aap contact nahinkar sakte, jab unki marzi hogi ye tab call karenge, payment pehle de ke aap phas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing experience . Very frndly and nice staff .. hats off to their patience and work . Amazing work. Keep up the good work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I can see you have not send better professional in the right time. Once the professional has appointed she asked me to reschedule it ,later she is not available,later another beautician who is less experienced has been assigned. Instead you would have cancelled the appointment. But you made me to cancel and charged for the cancellation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic service kindly avoid them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thorough professionals and they have a panel of quality service providers who give service to our entire satisfaction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They say ""booking without any complicated requirements"", then after you install the app and make a profile and give your phone number and email address, and as you are about to book, at the last step they tell you ""a complicated requirement"" which is they need an adult female at the location of the service at all time! I'm a male and I live alone, and this is why I need this service.... you think a company this big would have male cleaners! But no! Useless, uninstalled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unprofessional helpers very Unprofessional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were on time and did good cleaning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No professional service. Service not provided as promised. Waste of time and Money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not trust worthy, and pathetic customer support",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible experience!They do not serve you at all....not being able to provide a professional even after 1 week of prior booking, wasting our time and not even compensating is what they are good at.What a failure ðŸ‘Wish I could give .5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very poor service. Bookings are accepted while placing order. But they are continuously asking to reschedule (to take service like next day or even after 2 days). If they do not have sufficient professionals, better not to accept the bookings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst app. Their worker does not come on booking time they always ask for reschedule so don't use this app for services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not satisfied ,not pure cleaning , incomplete work lack of traind staff , lazy staffs,in complite their works, no punctuality We are very disappointed on their works..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very professional and very good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent services provided by the experts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent cleaning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't see rebook service option please solve dis problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will make sure.. I won't book any service in urban clap. They couldn't provide service for continuously 5-6 times and did not care to call back and try to arrange service. I would make sure I will not choose urban clap for saloon services at all. Thank you for your service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service ever. They don't have professional. I have booked kitchen cleaning service and the professional has completely damaged whole kitchen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Irresponsible. Do not intimate prior to delay in arrival or cancellation. If we cancel the services they charge cancellation charges. However reverse is not true. Pathetic services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on previous washing machine repair experience, the CSR used non branded part but billed us for branded part",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
service was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So prompt, punctual and reasonable. And the service agents do a thorough job, are transparent about payments and so well-behaved and helpful with other suggestions. Literally taken the hassle out of house repairs. Super happy with the 3 srrvices: carpentar (thrice), plumber and microwave repairer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All Services are available in pune and services are available for my place too,but the women salon services are not available,so pathetic.... totally disappointed,if you are available for other services ,why aren't you available for salon services at same location...look into it pls..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything about UC is deteriorating including the customer care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst ever experience...My appointment for full appartment cleaning was at 11 am n at 10 :50 am they call me n tell no person is available..I was fully prepared..pls don't do this to any other..it was worst situation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no option to contact the call centre or customer Service in the entire process. Its one way looting and killing people time and money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess now they have started taking customers lightly. Not following or even knowing if the service guy visited customer or not. Twice the professional guy just didn't turn without informing and UrbanClal has no idea about it. I called both the times but no reschedule update. I guess they are jut not bothered with customer satisfaction now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First experience is horrible booked pest control services and not able to provide professional from morning 8am .and at 10am they are saying they cannot provide services today .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maids don't show up and dont call you (multiple times) customer service is not helpful at all (they don't have access to a good system and have no authority) and the app is buggy. Just don't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst customer service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When Book any services forcsly add his add-on service ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't go for this ,Horrible service,I had seepage issue in my home I called urban company and the person has charged me 5k and he gave me 5-6 month warrenty for service , issue got started with in one month, when I called to the same person but no response and no proper response from Urban company also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very professional Services. I am very happy ðŸ˜Š,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible experience. Slowest customer service. They didn't call me back for my kitchen cleaning query which the professional had. I was standing with the professional for over an hour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I booked their services for today and without informing they rescheduled my booking time and then called to accept their assigned timing. If people have some urgency to go out urban company can ditch last min . Bad experience this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very Good Reliable and Affordable Services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worst customer service. Every time they assign some so called professionals, they end up not coming at their scheduled appointment. I've mailed customer support and no response from them as well. (This is not at all professional).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very worst service by urban company. Their so called professionals who don't even know the basics of professionalism. Fake and false promises & appointments. Unnecessary wastage of your time and effort. I booked their salon service thrice and eveytime nobody came and my appointment was rescheduled and again nobody came. Their professionals give silly & false excuses for not being able to come.I feel like a fool trusting them thrice and investing my time. Want to write so much bt word limitation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad. The carpenter assigned to me wants more money which was so unreasonable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is No Manicure and Pedicure Service for Mens/Boys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice app very nice sarvice ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have booked pest controler with this app... they hadn't informed us that it will affect pets... I have exotic birds in my home... when the pest controller arrived... my exotic birds was out if my home only... I took birds in only after 24hrs of applying bayers chemical... but the thing happend is I lost 50 birds worth rs 5 lac... very bad experience...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very bad experience till date, 2 services we availed till now, both are totally unprofessional, very bad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Termite treatment booked. After termination, I called and booked complaint but no one visited even after 20days of job done. Very poor quality and service. Regards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic. Poor experience in booking. Don't recommend to anyone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Excellent and prompt service by Sri Guravaiah , Plumber on 20th Oct 2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremely unprofessional work in full house cleaning I don't recommend anyone to use this app for house cleaning purpose. Didn't expect such a bad service. Uchi dukan fika pakwan suits well on this company's service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beautiful service..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During April 2021, my house was painted along with water proof treatment by UC partner with 6 months warranty. The promised services are not upto mark. It was delayed by one week to complete the job against commited days of 4. With in 3 months paint started peeling off. I raised compliant and UC sent same vendor for imspection. however he might have updated flase information to UC. After that i raised complaints several times through calls and whatsApp. Till no one turnedup to resolve the issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very professional and good work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please don't use any service.. this company is fraud.. please don't use..plllleeeeeeaaaaassssseeeee. .... don't use urban clap service.. bilkul nahi please guys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I took the message therapy offered by Urban Company, that was extremely good, looking forward to avail other services offered by them. Given Four Star as the early repair service was okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really happy with the service...careful handling of the professional...all the stains were removed well...thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not good at all. Female beautician are pathetic. They just talk talk and talk. They are more interested in ratings then work. I don't have option otherwise I will never order for female beauticians.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst experience.. The carpenter was supposed to install a study table but he took four hours to assemble. So you can image how professional he was. And extra charges were added.I have booked for your service yesterday but still. No response from your team regarding the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pathetic ,at every appointment , professional use to reschedule it and finally did not came .Stay away to avoid your time and effort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible experience. Do not ever trust their working patterns. We had opted for home painting and were totally cheated by the company. Our quotation included primer for full house but quantity sent was not sufficient even for a single room. And we were asked to pay extra. The quotation made was totally wrong. When we tried to raise a complain, they told us to talk to the painter and then we were redirected nowhere. It is a total fraud. Do not ever opt for urban company for any requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User friendly and staff also well professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plus subscription discount on salon services only 10% which I can avail instant of 20 %,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience. Have given them contract for painting. They have taken 35% amount and now it's 10 days no one has turned up not even a service call whether the work has started. After 10 days also they are not sure whether the sevice will start or not. Very Pathetic. Not expected service with such a good name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hi Team, App is not working whenever you try to book a service it says something went wrong. The worst part of it no customer care support for the app. Thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðŸ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best of all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good service and good product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic services. I have read comments but still thought ti go for it but it happened with me too. I booked beautician for 5.30am and at 4.45pm i came to know that some another beautician will come that to at 7.30 and when I called her she sounds dicey. Never book salon services from Urban clap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I hired urban company to get my house painted. I trusted the company. They provided me with the best material. The sales person was polite. We were told that we wouldn't need to do anything but it was a false claim from the company's end. The thekedaar was bad. UC should not hand over their work to such people. UC brought bad name to it's company sadly because of local thekedaar who is impolite, argumentative and disrespectful. Avoid UC, choose a better company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amazing service, helped me to get my bathroom cleaned",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No customer care no.. I had booked servise but no professional come at bookjng time.. And reshudule my booking by own.. Without my consern.. Very bad ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was so easy to cancel and reschedule. the services were good and puntual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gud but hair cutting charges are very high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Home cleaning services are very poor unprofessional and untrained people not satisfied with home cleaning service but I used other services they are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App is not working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Impropreat services, Poor Customer Service, Heavy Charges copare to services. Negative rating... Not Recommended at all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you Ritu !! she is an amazing beautician...I liked the sevice, it was my 1st experience with urban company and I'm fully satisfied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I need help with the app, i just downloaded it now and its not working. If i try to request for a plumber, it shows app not responding please try again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worst experience, booked them for full house cleaning, they came checked my house thoroughly and disappeared without saying anything, how weird and disgusting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bad service with bad professionals , if u got nice helper then it's fine else u will keep on call the company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prices of urbanclap is very high compared to the service given,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good service...but what is shown in ads & actual is difference about following covid safety measures..seems urban company earning profits from PPE's charges collected from customers..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useless and pathetic service. Called for changing my RO's filters as it was 5-6 months old. Post their service, the purifier has stopped working twice and they ask for 500-1k rupees everytime. Now again the purifier has stopped working. Pathetic service and trying to fool people by putting fake parts. Pleas go for local or your product's company service. You will end up paying double/triple the actual amount here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even after my request to add call option in app last year in May, no option added. Even their is no option for providing feedback apart from service. No option to chat or suggest some points",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't send this inefficient guy further for my bathroom Cleaning ....very upset with the result....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst experience..for a head massage the charge is 349 but at the final stage of confirmation charges are 627..how much you just add on??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazing app just loved it so much the nature of the employees were so polite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hi I can't book for makeup in my area Can you please check,it is booking 1 km away from my house it's saying government service not available in my area what the hell....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now not dependent on anyone for day to day work...like chimney cleaning, sofa cleaning etc.Overall happy customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where is the customer care number? Pathetic experience. I've already paid for the services and now the services aren't showing up on the app. Now how do I avail the services. Is this how you make profit by eating the money of people? Sheer nonsense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ery unprofessional attitude Had booked an entire flat cleaning On 20th October. I was asked to pay the entire amount of 5500/- And I waited for them to get back but no one approached finally gave them a call on morning and to my surprise they had no professionals to send for that day too. And not even for coming four days. I am surprised how do these companies survive, with so much of unorganized behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst customer care services. There is no value for the customers.. they simply think customers have so much of patience that they will tolerate whatever worst support provided. It is really waste on spending so much on advertisements if you are not providing required support for existing customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no way to reach the warranty. You ask them to call you back and they disappear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok app... the options marked after the service are mentioned in short... should be displayed in a proper way.. for a better response...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm trying to book classic salon service package from last 4 days but after reaching to payment stage it shows ""no professional available"" all the times! And it happens most of the times with your classic salon services which are cheaper as compare to your salon prime packages. Surprisingly In Prime salon packages which are way too expensive the unavailability of professionals pop ups never happened due to money making! What is the use of services if we can't avail them on time!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Be aware of their services. They use duplicate spare parts which needs regular replacement, they don't have a good customer support, they simply keep ignoring you complaints, I am also concerned about their employees, whether they do any proper background check.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst experience ever. Booked them twice for full house cleaning. No one came. I paid 17000 in advance. I wasted full two days waiting.. then they deducted 300 rs from refund ? Why? For not providing any services and causing so much trouble for me?? By the way . I have not received any refund yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I booked the hair cut service when I got leg injury. this service is Excellent even if you are a bachelor and can't go for saloon for n number of reasons. they kept a cloth under the chair and did the service and cleaned everything before leaving the place and service is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had booked for 2 bathrooms to be cleaned. When the UC professional arrived he said that one has a bathtub which is not included in bathroom cleaning services. I told him that a bathtub is a bathroom fitment. You must include the bathtub as an extra in your app if it is considered as a standard bathroom fitment (though it is). The person then cleaned the next bathroom and after he left I noticed long (2ft) drip stains of some oily substance below the exhaust fan. My house had just been repainted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good experience since last 4 yrs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not good. Horrible salon experiences. They are hiring third class service professionals and spoiling name n fame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My hair colour is not done properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Becoming costly...charge flat 100 or 200 for safety and what not fee.. we are also wearing mask n use sanitizer, we should also charge urban company.. mask is not only for customer but their own professionals.. the cost of actual work is over n above and no guarantee of sending a skilled professional",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their 95 % technicians are theives. They will steal money from you for no reason.. And the worst part is urban co. Doesn't take any action against them even if you give them enough proofs. Not recommended urban company worst experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst app. I am disappointed lot. I have booked a plumber. The app charged money immediately. But the plumber demanded huge money for resolving the issue. There is no value or service rendered for the money paid already. This is kind of cheat. I am uninstalling this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Luxury spa is an excellent service provided by urban company it's a must try,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I used this for salon at home. The beauticians are not well trained. They charge way more than yes madam. Dont have any customer care support. The beautician wont bring their own sheet. Unlike yes madan, you dont have option to keep the leftover product. Although, i've liked their cleaning services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice service feeling relaxed and comfortable Thanku you so much...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Getting something went wrong toast as soon as i select any category Update October 2021: this issue is yet not fixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Manisha is too good with her work....very polite n perfect with her skills...would like to hv her services more often,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not good facial all fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the worst services. Please don't use this app for repairing your household appliances. They only fix your equipment until their warranty period expires and wash their hands completely clean. Use this app at your own peril. They completely damaged my refrigerator and now am left with a hole of 30000rs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I took device to repair my led Android TCL Tv. Excellent ontime service. Technically strong service personnel. Most dependable company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mamta chaudhary who was assigned to my service was not interested in taking up this service in the first place as she mentioned she has a doctors appointment . yet she kept saying i will come at this time and that time. i have call records to prove the same. she is a pathetic horrible and not at all professional. also i am disappointed with Urban Company in general. kindly refund the entire amount asap. and i will never book again for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Guy sent for termite treatment did not know his job. I have demanded total refund, to get the work done from other source",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very much required for Bangalore. But these days professional are not completing jobs properly. Follow up from urban club is also homeless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the services of urban is good and on time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst app and service unprofessional staff who demaged my AC and telling that we are not responsible..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
service exceeding excellence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst app with no customer care number and Worst service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Spa services are the worst & this is over the years that I have experienced, it's better to go to a Suko Thai or Thai massage salons as none of the Urban Company ""spa professionals"" are really trained!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
polite and experienced techs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's the point of registering complaint when there is no action, no follow up call on issue. Why do the customer has to suffer all this after paying full amount",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Booked full home cleaning 1. Job left in between as partner had to leave early 2. Untrained team and a person who is not even employed by UC came 3. Throughout the day I was threatened that they will not complete service if I point out anything 4. The job was left in between by them and now no one has come for completing and I have raised complaints multiple times on the App too, but this still remains unresolved 5. Have already paid for the service and my service is still incom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Need option for choosing professional oneself, rather than one being thrust upon. Also need option for choosing haircut & hair color application services in one booking itself, rather than separate ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much has already been told about how UC isn't customer centric. I too had a bad experience when I noticed they are just the aggregators of local service providers and don't really care about the resource planning, keeping time commitment etc. Even their training is questionable with a so called ""professional"" at my place cleaned the sofa with a vacuum cleaner without a filter in it, blowing the dust all over my house. And no, he didn't forget to put it inside, he felt its easy that way!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dear Team, We trust your engineer and complete the service around 4000 above amount paid online and offline. But he was not checked the TDS as per today Engineer Visit present TDS level was 7 only, And old engineer Nitin has disconnected UV filter and PCB. I was suffering from typhoid so my Dr ask today to check your RO. Today I open my complaint & your New Engineer checked and update about TDS issue, PCV and UV was disconnected. Is this type of service not acceptable at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sai divine team work was very satisfactory. They work was very peaceful and helpful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No contact point to resolve the immediate issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Actually I want to give -5 star. I have booked for Home dusting and vacuuming four days before. And the message has come that they will assign team before 1 hour of service. But neither they assign anyone nor they send me any message before 1 hour. When I contacted them through app the message came that their team will call me but no call for them. And the funny part is after the service time passed the message is appearing in the app that they will assign team before 1 hour of service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality services at reasonable prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very well and professional staff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was good initiative of video call free of cost. One can discuss issues that need attention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rude customer care, extremely lazy and irrational service me ...you must understand happy customers is what make or break a business.. due to the experience, I would rather next time prefer to hire a regulat clear than so called white collar cleaning guys",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad sarvice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I booked Platinum deep cleaning for 16oct. at 9am. At7.30am in the morning, I recd. a call that we are trying our best arrange people for you. Than after some time again I receive a call that we are not able arr Now the matter is that, when you have not provided me any service, why should I retain the membership.I do not want to use any service of yours. Therefore, I request you to refund my membership fee also. With such a bad experience I am not going use any service of your company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very nice guy good at work and behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Forget about the App; improve your service and become transparent in your dealings with customers. You won't survive very long the way you are going, hoodwinking customers into paying for what they didn't want in the first place. Shame on you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Feel free to book a service only to get persuaded to take a more expensive service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Team of thieves exploiting workers and providing substandard products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Complete material for the project was delivered in one go. Not everyone who were involved in the project execution were aware of the full requirement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have booked 9999 monthly plan for a chef. After couple of days , chef informed me he had an accident and company will send an alternative chef for some days. But for two days no one has turned up . And company doesn't give a damm on the money the customer has paid . I heavily urge to compensate the days of the absence of the chef by extending the due date atleast. Booked a complaint on the app. No reply back so far. Still now I couldn't find any customer care number to talk on the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seriously very poor and pathetic service and urban company is fraud my booking was today but still no any executive was come and I was made the payment also but still no any updates all advertising is fake to there are no any customer care support and not getting any help I request you please don't book anything from urban company it's fraud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst thing of your app is you don't have any direct communication option to reach out to you guys in case of any issues of booking/ cancellation and you guys call yourself as PROFESSIONALS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect solution for small or big Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good user experience except for a couple of goof ups.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible Service... if you do not want to waste your time and money please avoid Urban Company... they take money in advance and schedule an appointment but nobody will turn up as per schedule and then when you call up to complain they will reschedule the appointment and again nobody will turn up... post that if you raise a call back with their customer support team... they will tell you to go and complain wherever you feel like... complaining to their founder Abhiraj Bhal is useless... frauds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very poor service, they don't have any customer care no. Or any other mechanism to resolve your complaints. They reschedule your appointment without even your confirmation.. And also if the person concerned arrives they always asks for more money by saying few services haven't been included in your pack or the area concerned is bigger and they have hundreds of other excuses to fetch more money from you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paint delivered 2 hours after Painter arrived. Work not starting as I am unable to make payment online as the payment portal of Urban Company is not working. It keeps buffering and then resets automatically to starting page.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perfect service ,I vill recommend UC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Urban company is truly a very unprofessional company and the people they recruit to do the job are pathetic. Professionals assigned the job cancel the assignment at their own whims and fancies or they give absurd excuses for not doing the assigned job. My experience with UC for cleaning three BHK apartment was horrible. The professional assigned the job assured me that he will reach on time and surprisingly cancelled the booking at his own end. Horrible company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very good, useful app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad!! They Keep changing the date and taken the money and hasn't started working yet !!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service ever hadðŸ˜žðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV service done by Mr. Anwar is excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible experience....No one turned up post 2 hrs in spite of slot booked 3 days prior. Does UC think customer is fool/idiot to wait for your workers to come anytime in the whole day. Why do you accept bookings with advance payment( 3 days prior) when you are not capable of handling . Why there is no customer care number in your app. No commitment towards service, simply make fools of customer by making them plus member with zero service. Complaint registered but no response so far. Pathetic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The scheduling is shocking. 4 cancellations in a row. And rescheduled appointment is a week after. For home cleaning. Don't trust the available times shown by the app. The team also usually will let you know regarding cancellations a few minutes prior to the booking time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted to repair printer in my office but there is no option for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not professionals , only in app pics lioking good , technicians are very bad they don't know how to work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all is well but I think your service will go outside of the City,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's getting bad day by day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Started out well, easy yes but professionals are at times untrained or lack basic courtesy. Worst is your policies towards customers & professionals, both. You don't pay them and they harass customers and you don't have a customer care service in place wherein we can reach you directly. Wastes our time following for things that can be purely addressed with basic professionalism. Uncool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excelent service done we are very much satisfied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad service . Sofa cleaning was pathetic . After serving there is bas samples coming from sofa . They are not taking any responsibility .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please refund my money back as you are not able to fix the problem. Same problem in my refrigerator is still exist.people should contact local technician instead of UC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kudos for training and equipment. But let me ask you one thing, are you paying enough to your service provider. Lot of my friends told me that they gave their own number for further assistance and I experienced the same. And what is that emphasis on 5 start rating. The best way for feedback is customer calling trust me UC how do you know who is giving feedback. And my rating was 5stars before and the funny thing is I didn't even rate the app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes app good useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Service providers are fully trained and give excellent services in all fields. Use latest technology and don't leave a mess behind, that's the best part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Executives not as professional as expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why does the app keep crashing while booking certain services?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent job carried out by the team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad system fraud customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not done the job waste of money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good sevice and plenty of options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Booked total house cleaning.....the job was done incomplete....kichen and many areas was not done properly . Two out of four boys were absolutely lazy and untrained...not at all professional. Informed UC ..but till now the incomplete work is not done. Highly dissatisfied this time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
service is very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service.Highly satisfied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Booked for the first time and lost interest in this service. I keep getting calls for reschedule and they never show up. Is the cancellation/reschedule charge only applicable to users? Or do you actually have some proper guidelines? Why show up all slots instead of the actually available slots? Hopeless and horrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Third class service. Vendors don't listen customers. Without service charge customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst app because dealer did not serve properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had pest control services from Urban company. Nice experience. ðŸ‘ðŸ»,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bad experience with UC painting services .The surveyor didnt do his job well ,This ultimately went a long way in derailing the whole project .Completely lost faith in painting services .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CHEATERS! They show FAKE offers on their website to attract clients. Once the service is taken, they say ""Oops! it was a technical issue. You are not eligible for any offers"". I have unistalled the app and never booking from them again. Totally UNRELIABLE!! It was my first and last order from Urbanclap. WORST EXPERIENCE! Rude and unhelpful customer care!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service given,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Never expected this from UC, i booked RO service Full comphrensive pack of 1900rs for my pureit which says they will replace all the filter ,after making payment professional assigned and he said additional amount to be paid.This is the level of treatment for UC paid member. Still no resolution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useless app...the professionals are least professional...the customer support is also useless...worst experience...will never again go for it.. good for nothing app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Does not provide proper expert for the category u pay ...neither bother of clients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Magic!!! Up to the mark always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good haircut and Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor quality services Unprofessional personnel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Iam booked bathroom classic cleaning, but they are come and told me change the pack to move in deep clean, so iam change my package,and I pay G-pay,but still i open my app your classic cleaning payment is pending,I search your customer care number but I didn't get any number, finally I pay extra money how can I solve this ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The professionals hired by them are very casual and don't take their work and client's time seriously.There is no point of booking an appointments as they'll give you services according to their convience. It's very tough to reach out for customer support and even if you do the staff is unable to resolve the issue. Very disappointed!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was very satisfied with the work good job urban company keep going ðŸ’¯ percent satisfied,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Urban clap employees are regularly dumping waste/used items outside my home. During Pandemic times, they are dumping used cloth, gloves, plastic combs etc which is dangerous to our health. Extremely unprofessional conduct by urban clap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only one person was deputed to clean the kitchen. We had to help him in doing most of the work. Why should we pay Urban Company if we have to work with them. I had booked for complete kitchen cleaning but the person deputed for work didn't know how to clean the painted space. We were left with no option. We could not communicate with UC because we didn't find any contact number. Will someone suggest me how to rate the services of Urban Company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
super ..electrian is good polite and experienced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am booked for 32 inch lcd panel replacement after seeing the rate card of urbanclap. But when technician came he told that this rate card was too old. And the rate is much more as compare to uc ratecard. Why don't you update your rate card?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No proper support. They never come on time. It's better to check for local help rather than going with this company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service in india .. degraded app ( over rated),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recently I received service from urban company for my top end water purifier, they have assigned request to the professional who blasted the same by replacing incompatible parts and collected around Rs. 4k from me. When I complained same to urban company they have given the assurance of correction on call. After that no response from customer care, I am not able to reach the number or no body is contacting me, so I request you to be careful, we can't trust these people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was about to buy some services but after looking at the experience of others I changed the mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very very very very very cheating company and very dirty company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always prefer Urban Company because I can get things done sitting in the comfort of my house at my own preferred time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have booked and paid for move in deep cleaning and they provided the service of classic cleaning, very very poor service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
each and every corner of.drawrs ..very well done ..thanx urban clap...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service by UC. No chance of foul play. Really appreciate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience.... I have a program in the evening so l booked salon for men... But two professionals declined to come... One of them asked me for reschedule and another cancelled... I am really very much disappoinnted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My last luxury pedicure was a horrific disaster which left me with a scar on my left foot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highly unprofessional so far as Kolkata Spa for women is concerned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst for home cleaning. Very pricy for such pathetic service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very unprofessional...will never trust urban company...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I order geyser repair , and the charges for 300 and then service man come and tell geyser want to do service , and service charges will be 600 so total 900 per geyser , it is very unfair I know geyser is repair he came and tell same repair So u want to do repair and charges",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are 2nd Ola. who want to earn from customers & service providers both. without giving any great benefit to other 2 parties. no customer care. services highly charged with huge UC margin. they are also fooling around with customers. unfortunately we don't have any other option, hence forcefully have to use their services until we find better option",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience no contact number available no professional assigned even after paying before such a waste of time and money I will not recommend anyone to use this app and service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience they don't respond on time they don't assign professional on time they don't even give slots to reschedule service very poor service they should close their company waste of time and money given them prepaid amount still there is no response very poor service I would recommend everyone not to book any service from here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I have opted for Painting Services for Urban Conpany. Painter has absconded from site since of 12.10.2021, citing Grand Mother has expired and on 13.10.2021 same painter has reviews posted of service done at other site. DONT UNDERSTAND IS IT A JOKE WITH US AS CUSTOMERS. URBAN CONPNAY, PLEASE HAVE HONOURS TO REPLY.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The membership thing is a complete trap. Before taking the membership every service is cheap and the moment you pay for membership, the price of every service is increased and they are making a fool out of us by giving discount on that service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FESTIVE 100 Is a FAKE. Too expensive. Stylists frequently cancel and ask for cash payment because they claim they are getting it late from Urban company. They refuse to colour moustache and french beard even though I had mentioned this when booking. Then I had to cancel as he also asked for cash payment. Where is your contact number? If I want to clarify on some things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No use , littrally no use , I have used service pest control , paid 1450 and still cocroqt are roaming in my house and WHERE CAN I CALL FOR COMPLAINT I don't know UC don't have customer care no. Very disappointed , is se to acha kisi local bande se kam karwa lo yar .......",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My washroom wasn't cleaned properly so I asked for a revisit. The professional cancelled the booking. The company promised another revisit today at 8am. No-one turned up. So guys it's like this if your work is done well , it's fine. If there's a problem ,the issue doesn't get resolved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Honestly cannot waste more time writing a detailed review. They haven't turned up for two days despite repeated calling. The whole company seems to be a scam . The customer care calls back rarely but it's not like they care. I think even the managers and everyone is in on it. So don't think escalating any problems will help. They don't care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I book for 11 and uc self change my booking time when not when I am not available. There no customer support from you there no number for calling costumer care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very nice services provided... excellent work done by their professionals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alternative number facilities to be inserted.. I was keeping inform from last 2 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Urban company ke professional bina bataye booking cancel kar dete hai bhout hi kharab technician hai urban company me or time pe bhi nahi pahuchte hai system badlo urban clap or mujhe jawab do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UC gave the opportunity to be groomed anytime!! Salon at home is a boon for busy ladies. But yes professional of preference and slot time availablity is not good always.even the customer care should be easily accessible. Prices of same service is different in different categories. UC please resolve these issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst experience I faced ever.. my skin came out and it turned into red patches later.i want to show the condition of my hands if there is an option to upload a pic...I wish I could give below one star ..not going to call anyone from urban company....really terrible experience..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's very safe and easy it save the time and our leg pain guys don't think twice just download and start your 1st booking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The good apps becauseThe always best clean and Science for urban club company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very very unhappy with the bathroom cleaning service... The professionals and service they show to us is totally opposite to the person they send us and the service.. Didn't clean the closet and few tiles were uncleaned. If I Could have called the local cleaner he will do the best service for lesser price... Totally waste of money and time...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We tried to book a pesticide service through this app, the first spray was done on time but after that professional was denied the service stating health reason we told uc to assign some other professional , they didn't do it on the required date but they assigned someone else who even after accepting the booking denied the service , there is no customer help in uc even if we ask callback they never callback worst app lost our money and didn't help with a single cockroach also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very bad experience with urban clap kitchen/bathroom cleaning services, second time in a row. Professionals are in hurry to complete the job without even completing full work. Like today professionals said job is completed while floor cleaning was not done. And I am finding many fittings/surfaces like fridge top are not even dusted forget cleaning with wet cloth. Not satisfied with service, I don't recommend using urbanclap. I feel being looted with membership fee also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Price is too high and also there is no customer care service number to whom we can complain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"our experience is the other way. We gave our 55â€ Sony television for repair through Urban clap on the 14th Aug 21. Their service provider Srinivasan Electronics, (No. 33, T H Road, M R Nagar, Kodungayur) promptly returned the same on the 17th. However, immediately after they left, the unit was not functioning and we complained to Urban clap who made the Service provider viz. Srinivasan Electronics to take the unit back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good before time visited and done, very professional",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good amd polite service persons. The option of choosing your prev service person is v good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do far it was a good experience.. punctual and professional service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best service from nisha .. amazing experience.. amazing work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great job by urban company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic in house cleaning services....don't book service at list for cleaning...u just wast your money and harsh your self along with time..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unable to reach customer service for queries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I use this app often but this time the beautician arrived and later denied the service demanding me to make the payment directly to her.Pathetic Experience.Even after requesting for call back I didn't receive it .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good service by Mr.Venkatesh highly recommended,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whitewas started after full payment. Team is not coming to work regularly. Whole work estimate was 5 days. After three day not even a single room is complete. STUCK BECAUSE FULL MONEY IS PAID BEFORE WORK STARTED.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have booked a service for cleaning our bathrooms and it was worth every penny. Thank you Urban Company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Professional always conflict once visit home. I booked for sofa cleaning but professional asked to count puffy as individual seats as well as cusion which is part of sofa as seperate item. This happened to me and my relatives in past as well. Please do not go with urban company and check other vendor. Urban company charged 50rs for safety but professional visited my home did even wear mask and they charged for PPE kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Happy with the service very professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible experience because of unprofessional people associated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not providing customized products rather a fixed products and price, forcing to spend a lot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall we are very happy with the service. It's professional and very clean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service provider but require more detail in service description,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No contact details if one wishes to talk/complain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Both my requests were not met the carpenter was not assigned, the beautician asked me to reschedule",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never had this kind of horrible experience with urban company. It has been 3 days since my complain was registered. Still there is no response from your side. Are you people really care about your customers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worst experience with pest control, professionals denied services so many times and no help from the company . Waste of money and time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got refund but very late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I liked Poonam Singh's work, she's is polite and good at her work, she gave me good foot massage ðŸ˜Š..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We commited a mistake by downloading this app. We never had such a bad experience dealing with anybody. The painters who came at our house were pathetic and the expert did not help us even after a lot of complaints. Once we paid him the money he stopped picking our calls. The painters were so rude and irresponsible that they almost broke our TV.They didn't even follow covid guidelines. We will never use this app ever again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the extra 39 rupees I am paying for safety measures is not applicable on my services. Hence I want a refund on the safety and support fee.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No service just wasted my time even after booking waited for two hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worthless go to the local market and get more convenient options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had one service which wax waxing full hand full legs and underarms which was not at all good and was incomplete coustomer care told me that you will get next service all free of cost but now m not able to do that they are still asking me to pay for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Experience was bad with last booking .had facial zero effectiveness on skin .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was beyond of expectation... Superb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M changing my ratings from 4star to one now just because of the my last experience of salon service. The lady didn't look like any kind of professional and literally she was continuously bussy with her phone calls and chats.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The professionals and services are top notch and have amazing experiences with UC.. They are my first choice and would be really okay to pay a bit premium price to them because of service experiences :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service is accurate and experience is good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I took deep cleaning& washing machine services today.service staff is forced to give 5 rating. Rating that we are giving, they are not accepting. They are saying they won't get their next assignment if we don't give excellent as rating. Did not like that really.Forcing the customer to give 5 rating ,I really did not like. Feedback is something which should help you improve. They kept the waste outside my house & did not put it in the dustbin. Even extra money is given",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not at all true worth. urban company claims to give timely service but that's not true. I had Booked my services 1 days prior but the beautician didn't turn up and she informed about the same 5 minutes before to the set timing (3pm).Urban company is such unprofessional that they rescheduled my services without my consent for 6:30. Never trust urban company when there is urgency as they will never understand the delay or disappointment that you will go through. Refund my membership & service fee.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad experience !! First time order for 2BHK deep clean - Manager denied to remove and keep the goods from the location .. without that how one should can do the deep clean and goods we have to remove then what is meaning of deep clean ? That lady don't bothered about lossing one order also .. very high attitude .. not recommended .. better call someone whoom you know it .. they will do it and better way .. not even proper no to communicate as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad experience with sanitizing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Never take services from this company .When we were facing issues with the vendor,we did not receive any help from Urban company guys. The main reason for selecting this company is that it will work as an intermediary between the customer and vendor but our issue was resolved by ourselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
V good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service persone behavior very bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overalls very good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no option in the app to write to customer care for any query,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very very poor service.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Karthikeyan has done good job. I am satisfied fully.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The most pathetic and unprofessional service provider company ever seen. Either the professional is never assigned, when assigned ana amateur comes and makes a mess, when trying to raise any issues no response/ no resolution. Ready to charge cancellation fee, but what when customers all plans are shattered when professional isn't assigned/ doesn't come? Never recommending this to anybody. Would have given negative stars if possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad service and the employee tried to cheat customer. Had two times cheating experience. I am totally shocked previously so nice the company is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prices are heavy ,cant affordable compared to local services and Electronics anyways both does the same job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ac servicing was done very nicely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very much unprofessional.Send a carpenter who is froud.Took money as advanced but not came after that. And dissapeard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes one get deceived by advertising campaign and positive reviews of companies and believe they would be trustworthy. I took the hair cut service for my child after believing they would do their work efficiently & professionally. During booking the slot I took the option of 10 AM. For next 3 hours their was no communication when they will send their barber. Finally the barber came after 4 hours. He did the hair cut of my child like sadak chap barber. Total waste of money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good and vert usefull app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent service.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unprofessional attitude. We booked for apartment cleaning on a Sunday but no one available. Harassment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even the deep intense cleaning of bathroom was below average and totally unworthy .Completely unsatisfactory .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the best experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shows wrong slots of professionals, happened multiple times. Check the availability before showing it on the app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr Shyamlal very good and professional 50 service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highly unprofessional behavior of UC partners in Patna. Twice has my booking been randomly rescheduled to the whims and fancies of the partners. Very disappointing and unreliable. Please associate yourself with reliable people else your credibility will go for a toss!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cancellation fees 100rs No update if booking cancelled or not No prompt customer service Time consuming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst ever experience with UC. Got my new flat cleaned but it seems like it was never cleaned at all. No customer support. UC sucks. Request all to not install this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer care number not visible on app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tejaswini was really good and very professional . She was on time and done as per my requirements thanks Pranita Shastry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good Service by Yuvaraj by did a good job.Thanks to urbenclap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No backup services available for equipment failure. Was forced to cancel. If customer cancels the service they are charged cancelation fees. Had cancelled an important event ans planned for this services. Very unpleasant experience. No call center support available to talk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very horrible, company is not responding properly. After taking a booking and payment they are not responding properly. They misbehave and harass their customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Committed professionals. The services can be relied upon for efficiency and costing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop calling back ppl for visiting a certain section of your app. It's bloody annoying. If we really want your services, we will book on the site or call",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I had booked a package of 2 services for my 2 window ACs. First service is availed and now there is no option to book second service. Money lost. Worst this about the App, there is no option of putt any complaint. Payment is taken in advance and there is NO Grivance redressal sysytem. Contact US option is missing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have paid for two services as told by the company.one service done earlier..waiting for second service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Services too good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tried twice... 1.Customers are getting cheated with higher charges by so called professionals - who are untrained and thugs who UC is partnering with. 2. On call englosh talking executives talk as if they are doing favour to customers. 3. My refrigerator was damaged an the insurance claim was declined. Unethical ppl who handled my case( 16th and 17th Oct). If there is any proces to Audit the calls and such ppl.should be sacked for misguiding customers & trying to protect the person who damaged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Conflict of commitment with sales and painting professional. No proper communication channel with urbancompany. Raised a complaint but no call back , no refund , no cancellation. Could have given -ve rating if any , dissatisfied. Do ur due diligence before paying any amount to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veri veri good company provide professional thanks you arban company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am always overcharged in my last 3 complaints,ad mentioned in app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expensive service of urban clap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Customer service support is very rude, don't pay online. After work. Because if paying in advance they talk like a king if any issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I booked my first appointment. It got cancelled automatically. Worst experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I had booked a painting consultation along with cleaning, but no one was sent for painting. I called twice for refund and yet don't see anything initiated. Absolutely pathetic if I have to keep calling customer care for this. I was informed money would be credited to UC wallet which ideally should be an immediate process, even that didn't happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best app with professional employees Highly recommended,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible and terrible. They have no customer care option and their professionals cancel the service and we can't contact them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you do not have professional available to serve in my area why you have charged UC Plus membership fee and there is no option under Help center to report the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the last moment UC reshudled my booking from 8.30 am to 3 pm I had a flight to mumbai so I had to cancel my flight because of UC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hidden rates are there which add additional cost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Booking done for plumber in the time slot of 9 to 9.30 AM, plumber came at 12.30 PM after repeated calls. Basin mixure was installed well within 15 minute . But UC has the same instalation rates for sink mixure and basin mixure wall hung or counter top, rates should be different for both because wall mounted sink mixure take more time for installation , the rate mentioned in the list is ok for wall mounted sink mixure and basin mixure installation rate should be less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plz add terrace cleaning service...it's important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad do not give clear information and then they want more money ask us to upgrade package v v bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the most pathetic app I have ever seen. I booked service yesterday they assigned me one professional after that she called and given me some reason that she can't come then urban company team told me you will surely get this service for tomorrow now they are asking still there is prblm we can't assign I said it's you should cancel for that also they are not responding. I can't contact then anywhere .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very high prices. Do not try for gyeser installation they are very very expensive. Be care full before do big mistake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor customer service and under certified and under trained staff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why do you list out Make-up and Hairstyling services if it's not done anymore. I wanted to book for my daughter naming ceremony but was unable to do so. Later found out that they have removed those services. The worst part is I enquired about this package by via their email help support and they easily answered all my queries. The support could have informed earlier only that those services are no longer provided. Very disappointed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
professional and great job done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pease full...proffessional work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst app till now Hard to operate and back office persons not attending properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a pretty good app for services in Delhi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suddenly urban clap has started assigning men for women's hair care services without giving the choice of opting for a lady. What kind of service is this ????,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very nice service ðŸ‘Œ ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very excellent service ðŸ‘Œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Urban company service man forced me to change all my water purifier filters twice with in a duration of 3 months,paid around 7000, feeling cheated. Please avoid such wrong practices to retain customer trust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good but professional doesn't make threading proper ...poor result in threading...nd only mask wear no any safety measures use like sanitizer, mask sheet etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never ever opt for any service.... Trust me u'll regret ur decision later... Rather go for local vendors... These people vanish after making the customer pay in advance... And even after advance payment they don't even match the expectations of customer. No response from customer support and supervisors. Useless staff...Useless company..... Thieves of modern world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Where is the customer care or contact number locayed in the app? We had booked full home cleaning service for today. We faced lot of issues hence we canceled the booking. A lot of time and energy was wasted in canceling, rescheduling the booking. This is the first time we experienced such service from your company. We could not find a way to reach you through the app or phone call. 1. One of the cleaning staff was stinking with bad smell which remained in our house for 2-3 hours after they",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent work great job ðŸ‘Œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most useless sales and staff I have ever experienced I book twice a week. They promised same Person will arrive which has never happened last three weeks. A customer care person will call and promise and nothing happens third time in three weeks professional has not showed up.. I am even ashamed to use the word professional... I have to reschedule my appointments because the person will arrive and when I call they pick the call and disconnect... complete Waste of my time and patience.useless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Never ever take service from these third class company.. Who never give good service, stupid Uneducated unprofessional s, they cancel service and don't care to inform",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kaleem did a very good job at painting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One the worst customer service ever. Continuous harrasment by their team without even them going through the complaints. They will all of a sudden change the pattern of which bank they are accepting NetBanking services and give contionous calls to harass you .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useless and poor customer service. Yes Madam is a better service provider for Salon services. Good that I don't make advance payments, because the technician/ beautician are never assigned and no one calls from customer support even if requested. Ultimately, had to cancel the service twice! Just don't make payment in advance, atleast the money is saved!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Urban Company made domestic jobs pretty easy. Excellent scheduling and fantastic job. Thank you very much Urban Company Team!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad experience. It's the first time I used urban company and booked a slot for cleaning. The technician has not arrived.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very disappointing...do not honour bookings....last minute inform us that beautician is not available...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why am I charged seperately after service when there was clearly no receipt given for the same. The service man asked to wire him directly than the company. This is not right. People please be aware of this nonsense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lot to work on ui,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great initiative by urban clap specialy the parlour service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Changing my rating from 5 to 1. Over promise, under deliver 3/5 times. Washroom cleaning service is useless. The guy did nothing rather created more work to be done after he leaves. Did nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overcharged ( charged 350+ for minor screw tightening work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never suggest Dulux paint for your customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aim of the company is to robb the customers. They collect charges just to send technician at your door. Main game started thereafter. In the name of repair or change of parts they charge you hefty amount. No bifercation of charges they have disclosed on their app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's was really a good experience..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not even worth for 1 star. On 19/09/21 the contractor named Virendra visited the place, gave qoutation for repair & painting job, with his professional suggestions we agreed for that & booked 16/10/21to start the work.. But on 16/10/21 their behaviour changed, the approach was like they can work on their own wish, they r list bother of consumer complaints.Support team compelled us to cancel the order or postpone for new week, which is not possible. A pathetic, unprofessional organisation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did a big mistake by giving job of house painting to Urban Company. Highly unprofessional and inefficient bunch of people at UC & they take 100% money in advance before even starting the job and you will get stuck with them. Didn't deliver shades on time. Work didn't start on time. Wrong shades were delivered at my home. They sent a 16yr old child for the paint job. They don't follow covid protocols. Untrained labor. Lot of iconvenience to senior citizens.ZERO customer service. Disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is not all good service no help center calls and service was very bad plumber service and expensive more than actual only before only it was fine after they done it became worst our 8k was wasted don't waste your time and money for this bullshite services app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My experience was horrible. I booked an appointment which was immediately accepted. They were to assign me a technician. The next morning I get a call almost 3 hours before my appointment that there was no technician assigned yet but they will try my best. After that I kept trying to get in touch with them dropping multiple messages requesting for a call back but neither a call back nor a technician was provided. It was finally past my appointment time when I had to cancel my appointment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If there was zero in rating i will definitely give it... Not thirdclass... But there is no class service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assigning service person should be better. had to postpone be os no one was assigned yday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great App, Great Service",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No services available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst ever experience in service industry. Took appointments confirm it. Alot the agent then at eleventh hour call to cancel the appointment. Remember I am there contract customer who have paid extra to get benefits as well. Disappointed and will never use them again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How do I book for only window+balcony cleaning for all 5 windows+balcony of my house?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible service....Absolute ripoff , the technicians suggest to install a new once instead of repairing the appliance and leave in just 5 mins and we are charged 300-500 for that... The billing should be done on basing on the work done after inspection, how can you charge beforehand.. there is no customer support helpline to rech out to .. And on the previous booking , the technician had taken money for a switch and that is still showing as an unpaid amount. Modern robbery , double charges",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the services seem excellent on the surface..the service is actually pathetic. Twice i tried booking salon services to save some time on weekend. The beautician will call and request if she can come a little earlier. Even post that no one turns up on the allocated time. When you call and check they will tell you that they cancelled informed the backend but informinf you is not their job. Here comes the most irritating part.. the helpcenter can be contacted through chatroom only. Standard responses like i am sorry and i will look into this take 3-4 mins. All you can do is watch the window and fume So the whole point of saving time on weekend is out and instead you waste hours trying to find a solution. Pathetic experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I hired M Square packers and movers with urban clap. The services offered were not upto the mark. I have rates them 1 star and review but urban clap do not show my negative review on supplier page.   The review was   ***** WORST SERVICE OFFERED ******  I do not have an option to give zero star, I would give zero star.  I booked them to pack and move my house from Pune to Jeeran in MP. First of all the service provider asked me to pay full amount before thay pick up my goods. Then even after full payment the delivery wasn't on time. Goods were picked up on 30.03.2017 and expected delivery date was 04.04.2017. But to my surprise the goods were not picked up from Pune till 04.04.2017. Late picked up and late delivered. The transporter double time than agreed.  Secondly the transporter promised at the time of payment that the goods will be delivered at home, but after payment and when I have left Pune, he said he will deliver my goods on road ðŸ¤” and I have to arrange my own transport from state highway to my home. *They are FRAUDSTERS and CHEATERS.* They also told me that if I don't do as they say, means take goods on highway, he will say that they have dispatched the goods and the truck met an accident. Means the fraudsters did not do what they promise. Then apart from the payment made, I have to pay to the people who came to pack my goods, then I also had to pay to the driver who delivered goods on highway, also I had to pay for the transport arranged from from highway to my home and loading and unloading for the same. In all I ended up paying much more amount than what was agreed.  DO NOT HIRE M SQUARE PACKERS AND MOVERS. THEY ARE FRAUDSTERS AND CHEATERS.  DO NOT HIRE THWM.

I told him that the ACs were fine and he should just go ahead with the regular service. After a lot of nagging, he agreed. After service, one AC is not working at all and the other is making unbearable noise. There is no response from UC. ALTHOUGH THE COSTS QUOTED BY UC APPEAR REASONABLE ON FACE, THE REAL MONEY THESE GUYS ARE MAKING IS BY COAXING CUSTOMERS INTO UNNECESSARY REPAIRS AT EXORBITANT PRICES.

Do not use this tiffin service. Any other service will be better. The owner is a cheat. Urbanclap should really verify the service providers before lusting them. #urbanclap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Beware!! They are only mediators and not direct service providers.  If you are not satisfied with the service provided by the professional, urban clap has the worst customer care department.  If you provide an unsatisfactory feedback, it's upto you to follow up and not urban clap.  The insurance they promise won't even be talked about.  Avail services at your own risk.  Always go with direct company service even if it's gonna cost you a little more. You are sure about replacement part to be new and still continue to avail warrenty.  Even if you avail service, don't pay immediately over app or to the technician and wait for couple of days to be sure that there are no problems.   Here is my story.  Scheduled a repair for my washing machine. Technician visit suggested replacement of drum  along with few other parts which will sum upto â‚¹5k. Agreeing to the replacement, the technician came with a very old replacement part. Unfortunately my mom was attending the technician and not me. Conveyed the new part to look very old. Though I didn't belive it, it was the case. The next day, running the washing machine key on draining water over the outlet, not allowing water to fill up the drum.  When asked about it, the technician said we usually buy drum once and it'll lie in the godown for 5-6 years.  What the he'll, he just replaced a drum that's as old as my washing machine.  Regarding the water draining problem, he said it was fine when he replaced it.   Contacted urban clap customer care over app who suggested that they'll get back to me after contacting the technician. This was also conveyed over phone to me.  Post this I had to followup urbanclap over and over and till date haven't found a solution.   Lesson learnt.

You give a great UI/UX experience to customers but we are not here for that. We are here for the services that you offer on your app. Quality of those services is pathetic at times. It takes away the good experience one had with your services. And you need to be more people centric.

My experience with the Urban Company is not satisfying..as I have seen that your technician visited on schedule time but they are unable to complete the job..May be some time non availability of parts or no response....Should I think that we are paying for your services just for visit...? But in your app shows job completed...What a joke..,schedule time,service schedule,Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Initially booked person didn't turn up. Highly upsetting. Rescheduled. Next person was excellent. UC should not fail to keep appointments.,Rescheduled,service schedule,Negative,turn up,service person attitude ,Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have no guarantee that whether the booking will be done as per scheduled time. professionals aren't aligned as per the job and always professionals have in upper hand whether they can pick up the job or not. I have encountered 4 jobs got canceled due to professionals are in position to pick up. May be Cleaning Department can look into it and see process should be in place where all responsibilities are followed as specified. Happy to discuss in case you have any questions., jobs got canceled,service schedule,Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I scheduled a booking at 6.30. The professional said she will reach by 7.30, uptil now there is no update from the company nor professional. I think they do it after payment. I think payment in advance is a bad idea. The least a customer wants is timely information if you can't provide the service. Now I called, and the professional said that sje is not getting a cheap auto. Can you believe that? I had to call to enquire. She was peacefully returning home.",scheduled ,service schedule,Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was not even informed via call about the rescheduling of my booking. I was not even taken the concent prior to slot booking. What kind of hell of service you guys are providing.

Pathetic. Very unprofessional and worthless. Cancellation done at last minute and caused a major inconvenience and headache. I wonder how it's still working. Spoke with the customer care for half an hour and all they could is refund the amount. But what about cancelling at the last moment. I wasted one full day reserving it for you guys to come and finish the service. Deleting the app. It was good before but now no more. No more UC.,unprofessional and worthless,service schedule,Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Worst experience. Not trustworthy. They will give you a schedule and keep rescheduling it per their convenience.
